## Code Review

Merge request and code review processes

### `mr-review-workflow`

- **File**: `workflows/mr-review-workflow.json`

### `wr.mr-review`

**MR Review Workflow (v2 • Notes-First • Parallel Reviewer Families)** (v2.1.0)

- **File**: `workflows/mr-review-workflow.agentic.v2.json`

## Documentation

Creating and maintaining documentation

### `wr.document-creation`

**Document Creation Workflow** (v0.0.1)

Create BROAD or COMPREHENSIVE documentation spanning multiple components/systems. Perfect for: project READMEs, complete API documentation, user guides covering multiple features, technical specifications for systems. Uses complexity triage (Simple/Standard/Complex) to adapt rigor. For SINGLE, BOUNDED subjects (one class, one integration), use wr.scoped-documentation instead for better scope discipline.

- **Steps**: 11
- **File**: `workflows/wr.document-creation.json`

### `wr.documentation-update`

**Documentation Update & Maintenance Workflow** (v1.0.0)

UPDATE and MAINTAIN existing documentation. Analyzes Git history to detect staleness, identifies outdated sections, and systematically refreshes docs while preserving valuable content. Perfect for: refreshing docs after code changes, scheduled maintenance, addressing feedback. NOT for creating new docs - use wr.scoped-documentation or wr.document-creation for new documentation.

- **Steps**: 15
- **File**: `workflows/wr.documentation-update.json`

### `wr.scoped-documentation`

**Scoped Documentation Workflow** (v1.0.0)

Create documentation for a SINGLE, BOUNDED subject with strict scope enforcement. Perfect for: one class/component, one integration point, one mechanism, one architecture decision. Prevents documentation sprawl through continuous boundary validation (9+/10 scope compliance required). NOT for: project READMEs, multi-component systems, or comprehensive guides - use wr.document-creation for those.

- **Steps**: 10
- **File**: `workflows/wr.scoped-documentation.json`

## Exploration & Analysis

Understanding codebases and systems

### `wr.adaptive-ticket-creation`

**Adaptive Ticket Creation Workflow** (v0.1.0)

An intelligent workflow for creating high-quality Jira tickets. Uses LLM-driven path selection to automatically choose between Simple, Standard, or Epic complexity paths based on request analysis.

- **Steps**: 9
- **File**: `workflows/wr.adaptive-ticket-creation.json`

### `wr.discovery`

**Discovery Workflow (Bundled • Exploration + Design Synthesis)** (v3.0.0)

A bundled upstream thinking workflow that merges the old exploration and design-thinking workflows into one adaptive flow. It chooses between landscape-first, full-spectrum, and design-first paths while preserving a shared notes-first structure for framing, synthesis, challenge, and recommendation or prototype-driven learning.

- **Steps**: 12
- **File**: `workflows/wr.discovery.json`

### `wr.intelligent-test-case-generation`

**Intelligent Test Case Generation from Tickets** (v0.0.1)

Transforms ticket requirements into systematic test cases using evidence-driven analysis, dual-brain processing (NLP + LLM), document discovery, and progressive scenario expansion. Produces integration and end-to-end tests optimized for developer readability and LLM consumption with confidence scoring and validation loops.

- **Steps**: 12
- **File**: `workflows/wr.intelligent-test-case-generation.json`

## Learning & Education

Course design and learning materials

### `wr.personal-learning-course-design`

**Personal Learning Course Design Workflow** (v1.0.0)

A systematic workflow for designing effective personal learning courses with three thoroughness paths: Quick Start (3-5 days for essential structure), Balanced (1-2 weeks for comprehensive system), and Comprehensive (2-3 weeks for professional-grade pedagogical depth). Adapts complexity based on user time constraints and learning design experience.

- **Steps**: 11
- **File**: `workflows/learner-centered-course-workflow.json`

### `wr.personal-learning-materials`

**Personal Learning Materials Creation Workflow (Branched)** (v1.0.0)

## Using Workflows

Tell your AI agent which workflow to use:

```
"Use the bug-investigation workflow to debug this issue"
"Use the wr.coding-task to implement this feature"
```

Or browse programmatically:

```bash
# List all workflows
workrail list

# Get details about a specific workflow
workrail list --verbose
```

## Creating Custom Workflows

See the [Workflow Authoring Guide](authoring.md) to create your own workflows.
