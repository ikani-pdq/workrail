# Ideas Backlog

Workflow and feature ideas worth capturing but not yet planned or designed.
For historical narrative and sprint journals, see `docs/history/worktrain-journal.md`.

**Before reading this backlog, read the vision:** `docs/vision.md` -- what WorkTrain is, what success looks like, and the principles every decision is held against. Every item in this backlog should serve that vision. If it doesn't, it shouldn't be here.

**To see a sorted priority view, run:**
```bash
npm run backlog                                       # full list, grouped by blocked/unblocked
npm run backlog -- --min-score 11 --unblocked-only   # top items ready to work on
npm run backlog -- --section daemon                  # filter by section
npm run backlog -- --help                            # all options
```

Each item has a score line: `**Score: N** | Cor:N Cap:N Eff:N Lev:N Con:N | Blocked: ...`

**When adding a new backlog item, score it using this rubric.** Five dimensions, each 1-3. Score = sum (max 15).

| Dimension | 3 | 2 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Correctness** | Silent wrong output, crash, or skipped safety gate | Degraded behavior, misleading output, test coverage gap | No effect on correctness |
| **Capability** | Meaningfully expands what WorkTrain can do or who can use it | Reduces friction for an *active* use case today | Polish, internal quality, or nothing anyone is actively blocked by right now |
| **Effort** (inverted) | Hours to a day or two | A few days to a week | Weeks or longer, significant design work needed first |
| **Leverage** | Prerequisite for multiple other items | Enables one or two downstream items | Standalone, nothing depends on it |
| **Confidence** | Clear problem, clear direction, just needs implementation | Problem is clear, but has open questions to hash out first | Still needs discovery or design before work can begin |

**Blocked flag:** annotate with *what* the item is blocked by -- "Blocked: needs knowledge graph" vs "Blocked: needs dispatchCondition" carry very different timelines. Blocked items are listed separately regardless of score.

**Scoring notes:**
- Score the first actionable phase, not the full vision. Phase 1 = two days of work should not score Effort 1 just because Phase 3 is months away.
- Tiebreaker at equal score: prefer the item that makes the next item easier to execute.
- Capability 2 = reduces friction for an *active* use case today (not something hypothetical).

**How to write a backlog item.** Every entry should follow this shape:

```
### Title (Date)

**Status: idea | bug | partial | done** | Priority: high/medium/low

**Score: N** | Cor:N Cap:N Eff:N Lev:N Con:N | Blocked: no / yes (blocked by X)

[2-4 sentences stating the problem plainly. What is wrong or missing? Why does it matter?
No proposed solutions here -- just the problem.]

**Things to hash out:**
- [Open question that needs a decision before design can begin]
- [Another open question -- constraint, tradeoff, interaction with other systems]
- [Keep these honest -- don't fill this section with questions you already know the answer to]
```

**Rules for writing entries:**
- **State the problem, not the solution.** "There is no way to invoke a routine directly" not "We should add a `worktrain invoke` command."
- **No steering.** Don't tell future implementers how to build it. Capture what needs to exist, not how to make it exist.
- **Solutions belong in "Things to hash out", not in the problem description.** If you find yourself writing "the coordinator should..." or "a script that..." in the problem body, move it to a hash-out question instead. You may mention a possible direction in a hash-out question, but frame it as an untested candidate -- not a decision.
- **Things to hash out = genuine open questions.** Only include questions that actually need to be answered before design can start. If you know the answer, state it in the problem description.
- **Relationships matter.** If this item depends on another, or would be superseded by another, name it explicitly.
- **Be specific about what "done" looks like** when it's not obvious -- e.g. "done means an operator can invoke any routine by name from the CLI without writing a workflow."

## P0 / Critical (blocks WorkTrain from working correctly)

### Engine hint content fixes: correct misleading guidance on artifact validation failures (May 20, 2026)

**Status: done** | Shipped PR #1079 (v3.101.2, May 20, 2026)

**Score: 14** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:3 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

When an agent fails to submit a required artifact, the engine's blocked response actively misdirects it: (1) the `suggestedFix` says "fix `notesMarkdown`" for all non-assessment artifact contracts -- wrong, the agent should fix `output.artifacts`; (2) the circuit-breaker after 3 retries hardcodes "submit a valid `wr.assessment` artifact" regardless of what the step actually requires; (3) wrong-kind artifacts (e.g. agent submits `wr.assessment` when `wr.loop_control` is needed) are silently dropped with no feedback; (4) the empty-artifacts case produces the same unhelpful message as the wrong-kind case. The result: the agent receives contradictory signals from the step prompt and the blocked message, spirals, and terminates. This is the confirmed root cause of the 0/13 `wr.mr-review` success rate. Every artifact schema file already has a `getBlockedMessage()` function with a canonical example -- the fix is to wire the engine to use it.

**Discovery complete (May 20, 2026):** Design doc at `docs/plans/cortex-hint-content-design.md`. 4 targeted changes: extract `blocked-messages` registry to `src/v2/durable-core/schemas/artifacts/blocked-messages.ts`, wire `reason-model.ts` `reasonToBlocker()` to dispatch through it, fix `advance.ts:137` to use actual `contractRef`, add wrong-kind + empty-artifacts detection in `artifact-contract-validator.ts`. Ships independently, benefits all entry points (MCP + daemon). Must ship before SessionCortex Phase 1+2 -- the cortex hint content draws from the same registry.

**Implementation prerequisites:**
- Verify `pointer.contractRef` is populated on all `MISSING_REQUIRED_OUTPUT` blocking paths before wiring registry dispatch
- Add `wr.contracts.assessment` to the registry (currently handled inline in `reason-model.ts` only)
- Handle empty `output.artifacts` case explicitly -- this is the most common failure mode

### Daemon session harness: intelligent layer between agent loop and engine (May 20, 2026)

**Status: partial** | Priority: critical

**Score: 15** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The daemon's agent loop is currently a thin wrapper: start the LLM, execute its tool calls, check for stuck/stall, repeat. There is no layer that understands what the session is trying to accomplish, can intervene when things go wrong, or can do anything other than watch the agent loop until an external heuristic fires. This means sessions get stuck, spiral, hallucinate recovery paths, and terminate unexpectedly -- all of which are unacceptable outcomes when WorkTrain is supposed to be running autonomously overnight. The worst possible outcome (a stuck session with no recovery path) happens regularly today and has no principled fix.

The daemon owns the agent loop completely. Unlike the MCP server -- which is a stateless tool interface that cannot reach into the agent -- the daemon controls the LLM calls, intercepts tool calls, owns the message history, and can inject content at any point. This is the fundamental capability that makes a harness possible and that the current architecture does not exploit.

A session harness is a layer that sits between the agent loop and the engine and owns session lifecycle intelligence: pre-turn state injection (nudge the agent when a pending outputContract hasn't been satisfied), tool interception (enrich raw engine errors with step-specific recovery guidance before the agent sees them), failure pattern escalation (detect spirals and switch recovery strategy rather than letting stuck detectors be the only backstop), session suspension (true pause at any point -- waiting for MR review, operator input, a dependent session, a timer), daemon-side tool execution (read files, call APIs, check PR status and inject results as synthetic messages without going through the agent), and active steering (inject corrections when the agent goes off-track before things go further wrong). With a proper harness, "stuck" is never a terminal state -- there is always another recovery level before operator escalation, and operator escalation itself is a handled path, not an abnormal exit.

**Constraint: no AI in the harness.** All harness logic must be deterministic scripts -- state checks, counters, lookups, pattern matching. AI-based steering or recovery is explicitly out of scope.

**Discovery complete (May 20, 2026):** Design doc at `docs/plans/session-harness-design.md`. Selected direction: `SessionCortex` -- a stateful class subscribing to the existing `turn_end` event, maintaining per-step failure counts in a typed append-only crash-safe event log, driving a typed escalation state machine: `NoFailures -> HintInjected -> ScaffoldInjected -> StepRewound -> OperatorEscalated`. Individual behaviors are pure functions. Rejected two-chain interceptor approach (hot-path mutation, no shared memory, open/closed fails). Key insight: `SessionState` is not persisted to disk -- cortex event log is the minimum persistence surface for suspension/resumption.

**Implementation phases:**
- **Phase 0 (ready to implement -- engine fixes):** Fix the engine's wrong guidance content before building the cortex. Design doc at `docs/plans/cortex-hint-content-design.md`. 4 targeted changes: extract blocked-messages registry, wire `reason-model.ts` to use it, fix `advance.ts:137` circuit-breaker, add wrong-kind + empty-artifacts detection. Ships independently, benefits all entry points. See backlog item "Engine hint content fixes" below.
- **Phase 1+2 (shaped, ready for coding-task):** Cortex wiring + failure counting + hint injection + scaffold injection. Pitch at `docs/plans/session-cortex-phase1-2-pitch.md`. The cortex hint content draws from the same `getBlockedMessage()` registry as Phase 0 -- no hand-authored static strings needed.
- **Phase 3 (needs design):** Step rewind -- HMAC token protocol rewind mechanism not yet designed.
- **Phase 4 (needs design):** Operator escalation -- notification mechanism and timeout not specified.
- **Phase 5+ (future):** Daemon-side synthetic tool calls, context degradation checkpointing, session segmentation. Dynamic tool description per step (C3 from hint content discovery) belongs here if Phase 0+1+2 don't fully resolve daemon session failures.

**Open prerequisites before Phase 3/4:**
- Step rewind mechanism for HMAC token / append-only log protocol
- Operator escalation timeout and notification/response interface

**Shipped:** Phase 0 (PR #1079, v3.101.2) -- engine hint fixes. Phase 1+2 (PR #1081/#1084, v3.102.0) -- SessionCortex hint+scaffold injection, crash recovery, typed StepCortexState union.

**Remaining open:** Phase 3 (step rewind -- HMAC protocol rewind not yet designed), Phase 4 (operator escalation -- notification mechanism not specified). Phase 5+ (synthetic tool calls, context checkpointing) -- future.

**GitHub issues:** Phase 0 (engine fixes): #1074 (closed) | Phase 1+2 (cortex): #1075 (closed)

### wr.mr-review spawns full workflow children -- blocking review MVP (May 21, 2026)

**Status: partial** | Priority: high

**Score: 12** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

**Shipped (PR #1084):** Reviewer families now spawn `wr.routine-reviewer-family` (1-step bounded routine) instead of full `wr.mr-review` instances. This is explicitly a **temporary shim** -- see the routine's description for the permanent fix direction. The proper architecture is `spawn_agent` task worker mode (no workflowId, typed context contract, terminates on end_turn).

**What remains wrong:** The routine is a 1-step workflow container, not a true bounded task worker. The parent still blocks inside `spawn_agent.execute()` waiting for children. Context passed to children is free-form `Record<string, unknown>` -- no compile-time enforcement. The `spawn_agent task worker mode` backlog item captures the proper fix.

**Related:** `spawn_agent task worker mode` (backlog item below) is the architectural fix. `Coordinator-intercepted delegation` is the longer-term direction.

### C2 callback bug: parent stall timer not reset by child LLM activity (May 21, 2026)

**Status: done** | Shipped PR #1054 (May 19, 2026)

Fixed in `src/daemon/runner/agent-loop-runner.ts` -- `notifyParentActivity` now fires in `onLlmTurnStarted` and `onToolCallStarted`, not just `onAdvance`. The fix was diagnosed and shipped two days before this backlog item was written.

### Coordinator-intercepted delegation: workflow-declared parallel tasks owned by coordinator, not agent (May 21, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 11** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:1 | Blocked: no

**Needs full exploration before any implementation.** The design direction is promising but has open questions that require a `wr.discovery` session before coding begins.

**The problem:** `spawn_agent` as a tool called from within the agent loop puts too much responsibility on the agent: it decides to delegate, constructs child tasks, blocks waiting for children, and synthesizes results -- all while burning turns and stall timer budget. The parent's stall timer has no awareness that the agent is legitimately waiting for children. When a review workflow spawns 3 parallel reviewer families, the parent dies waiting because C2 doesn't fire fast enough.

**The direction:** The coordinator intercepts structured delegation instead of the agent executing it. A workflow step emits a `wr.coordinator_signal` artifact with `signalKind: delegation_needed` and a task list. The coordinator sees it, spawns bounded task agents autonomously (not workflow sessions -- just goal + tools + return last message), waits for them deterministically outside any agent loop, assembles results, and steers them back into the parent session via `agent.steer()`. The parent's stall timer is irrelevant because the parent's agent loop is **parked** (not running) during delegation.

**Why this is architecturally better than the current model:**
- Parent stall timer never fires during child execution -- parent isn't running
- Children are bounded task workers, not full workflow instances
- Coordinator owns delegation logic deterministically (no LLM routing)
- Results are assembled and injected cleanly before the parent resumes

**What the workflow declares:** A step can include a `delegationSpec` (needs design) describing what tasks to parallelize, what context to pass each, and how to assemble results. The coordinator reads this at step advance time and decides whether to handle delegation or pass through to the normal advance path.

**Open questions (need discovery before implementation):**
- Does `wr.coordinator_signal` need a new variant, or does the existing `delegation_needed` signalKind suffice?
- Should delegation be declared in the workflow JSON (compile-time) or emitted by the agent (runtime)? Compile-time is more predictable; runtime is more flexible.
- How does the coordinator know which bounded task type to use for each delegation? Does the workflow specify this?
- What is the interface for a "bounded task agent"? Just goal + tools + end_turn with findings in the last message? Or something more structured?
- How does this interact with `spawn_agent` as an agent-initiated tool? Both probably have their place -- bounded parallel reviewer families via coordinator vs. dynamic agent-initiated delegation for less structured cases.
- Is `wr.mr-review` the only workflow that needs this, or does `wr.coding-task` parallel slice execution also benefit?

**MVP path (before coordinator interception):** Fix `wr.mr-review` to use bounded routines or sequential reviewer passes (see above). Coordinator interception is the right long-term architecture but not required to unblock MVP review.

### wr.coding-task forEach loop exposes broken agent-facing state (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: done** | Shipped May 1, 2026 (PR #926)

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

**Root cause (diagnosed Apr 30, 2026):** The agent wrote `slices` as an array of plain strings (`["1: slice name", ...]`) instead of objects (`[{name: "...", ...}]`). The engine accepted the array (it was an array), entered the loop, and `{{currentSlice.name}}` silently resolved to `[unset]` on every iteration because strings don't have a `.name` property.

**Shipped (PR #926):**
1. **forEach shape guard** (`workflow-interpreter.ts`): at iteration 0, if the body uses `{{itemVar.field}}` dot-path access but the items array contains primitives, returns `LOOP_MISSING_CONTEXT` with a message naming the actual type and a preview of the bad value. The loop never enters with broken state.
2. **Diagnostic `[unset]` messages** (`context-template-resolver.ts`): when dot-path navigation fails mid-path due to a type mismatch (e.g. `currentSlice` is a string), the rendered prompt now shows `[unset: currentSlice.name -- 'currentSlice' is string ("1: Auth..."), not object]` instead of just `[unset: currentSlice.name]`.

**Remaining open (separate items):** context contract enforcement (systemic fix), `todoList` abstraction, `wr.loop_control` shown in forEach prompts.

**GitHub issue:** https://github.com/EtienneBBeaulac/workrail/issues/920

### Context contract: steps must declare required and produced context keys (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: tentative** | Priority: medium

**Score: 12** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The engine has no mechanism to enforce context between steps. `Capture:` instructions in step prompts are prose -- the engine accepts `continue_workflow` with empty context on every advance, silently. This is the systemic root of the forEach `[unset]` bug: the agent wrote planning output as notes, not as context, and the engine accepted every advance without complaint. The same failure can happen in any workflow that passes state between steps.

**Things to hash out:**
- What schema format should `contextContract` use -- JSON Schema subset or a simpler workrail-specific type DSL?
- Should validation be blocking (engine rejects the advance) or advisory (engine warns in the next step prompt)?
- Does context contract cover loop entry preconditions, or does the separate forEach guard item handle that?

---

### `todoList` step type: ergonomic abstraction over forEach (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Workflow authors using forEach must manually wire a prior step to populate the items array, understand iteration variables, avoid emitting `wr.loop_control` artifacts (which have no effect in forEach), and explain the loop framing to the agent. The forEach shape guard (PR #926) now catches primitive-item arrays loudly at loop entry, but the wiring between "the step that produces items" and "the loop that consumes them" remains implicit and invisible to the engine. The `todoList` abstraction would make this wiring structural.

**Things to hash out:**
- Should `todoList` compile to a forEach loop at the engine layer, or be a new execution primitive?
- How does the setup step that produces the items array get authored -- inline prompt, routine reference, or both?
- What does the agent-facing presentation look like: "Item 3 of 8" with item content injected, or something else?
- Should `wr.loop_control` artifacts be stripped from the step prompt entirely in a `todoList`, or does the agent still need an explicit completion signal?

### Agent is doing coordinator work

**Status: partial** | Near-term mitigation shipped PR #882 (Apr 30, 2026)

**Score: 9** | Cor:3 Cap:1 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The system prompt now explicitly scopes the agent to its worktree and instructs it not to read planning docs or run git commands against the main checkout. `Read`/`Write`/`Edit` tools enforce the workspace path at the tool layer (PR #892).

**Remaining:** Full coordinator-heavy redesign still needed. The agent sandbox (tool path restriction to worktree) is the architectural fix -- the system prompt is a mitigation. See "Agent sandbox" item below.

---

### Wrong directory: agent worked in main checkout instead of worktree

**Status: done** | Shipped PR #882 (Apr 30, 2026)

`buildSystemPrompt()` now injects the worktree path as the `## Workspace:` heading and adds an explicit scope boundary. Crash-recovered sessions also get the boundary via `AllocatedSession.sessionWorkspacePath`. `Read`, `Write`, and `Edit` tools all enforce the workspace path with proper normalization (dotdot traversal + prefix-sibling attacks fixed, PR #892).

### Agent faked commit SHAs in handoff block

**Status: done** | Fixed in `src/mcp/handlers/v2-advance-core/outcome-success.ts`

**Score: 11** | Cor:3 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

Agents no longer participate in SHA tracking. `outcome-success.ts` now always emits `agentCommitShas: []` and `captureConfidence: 'none'` in the `run_completed` event. The `startGitSha` and `endGitSha` boundary fields are still recorded reliably -- consumers that need the commit list should derive it from `git log startGitSha..endGitSha --format=%H` at query time. The console SHA display will show empty for new sessions until that query-time derivation is built (tracked under "Console session detail" / "Artifacts as first-class citizens").

### `taskComplexity=Small` misclassification

**Status: bug** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:3 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Issue #241 (TTL eviction across multiple files + new tests) was classified as Small, skipping design review, planning audit, and verification loops. Consider requiring human confirmation on Small classification before bypassing phases.

**Note (May 13, 2026):** Risk is non-linear for the self-improvement use case. When WorkTrain modifies WorkTrain, a behavioral change that bypasses design review can affect every future session. A misclassified Small is not just a quality gap -- it is a compounding correctness risk for the loop itself. Should be treated as higher priority in that context than score 9 implies.

### Daemon binary stale after rebuild, no indication to user

**Status: ux gap** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

After `npm run build`, `worktrain daemon --start` launches the old binary. No warning. Fix: compare binary mtime to running process's binary and warn if stale.

### `worktrain daemon --start` reports success even when daemon crashes immediately

**Status: done** | Shipped PR #898 (Apr 30, 2026)

Now polls `GET /health` every 500ms for up to 5 seconds. Only reports success when the endpoint responds 200. `WORKRAIL_TRIGGER_PORT` also added to plist captured vars so port overrides are consistent between shell and daemon process.

---

### Handoff block not surfaced to operator

**Status: ux gap** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

Agent writes a complete handoff block (commitType, prTitle, prBody, filesChanged) to the session store. Invisible to operator without digging through event logs. Fix: `worktrain status <sessionId>` should show it; console session detail should surface it prominently.

### Worktree orphan leak on delivery failure (Apr 21, 2026)

**Status: done** | Fixed via delivery pipeline refactor (Track B)

The delivery pipeline was extracted into `delivery-pipeline.ts` with explicit stage ordering: `parseHandoffStage` -> `gitDeliveryStage` -> `cleanupWorktreeStage` -> `deleteSidecarStage`. Sidecar is now deleted after worktree removal, not before.

## WorkTrain Daemon

### Dedicated Philosophy Compliance Gate Routine in `wr.coding-task` (May 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 11** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Implementing agents suffer from severe "focus-split" during active coding sessions (handling typescript compilations, terminal test errors, and multi-file logic), causing them to overlook high-level coding philosophies (immutability, exact ESM imports, avoiding parallel mutable states, type safety over primitives). Currently, there is no step in the `wr.coding-task` workflow that forces a late-stage cognitive audit checking for repository-level principles before handoff. This leads to codebases slowly decaying into localized patches despite system-wide instructions.

**Things to hash out:**
- How should the `routine-philosophy-audit` be modeled? It should likely run as a separate read-only session with a dedicated, isolated subagent that only receives the git diff and the repository principles.
- What should the `wr.contracts.philosophy_compliance` artifact structure look like? A simple JSON schema mapping modified files to the specific principles applied or trade-offs made.
- At what point should this gate fire? In Phase 7 (Final Verification) after the build and tests pass but before the handoff PR is created.

### Autonomous Session Context Pruning in WorkTrain Daemon (May 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 11** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

As long-running autonomous sessions proceed slice-by-slice, their context window gets bloated with thousands of lines of terminal outputs, compiler dumps, and raw file reads. This "attention decay" causes the agent to lose track of high-level system rules and repository philosophies in the noise of the active session, leading to compile-first-design-last shortcuts. Because MCP servers are stateless, the engine cannot prune context. However, the WorkTrain daemon manages the active LLM context and conversation payload directly.

**Things to hash out:**
- Should the daemon support a `pruneContext` directive at step boundaries in the workflow definition?
- How do we preserve essential session history (such as the initial task description, the implementation plan, and high-level decisions) while purging intermediate tool outputs and prior compilation failures?
- Does context pruning affect the agent's ability to maintain cross-turn consistency, and if so, how can we summarize the pruned turns to mitigate it?

### Git rebase workflow for agents (May 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 11** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

Agents asked to rebase a branch routinely make the same mistakes: they skip conflict markers, accept one side wholesale without reading both, fail to verify the result builds and tests pass, and don't check whether changes from both sides are still semantically correct together after the merge. A rebase done wrong can silently lose logic from either side or create code that compiles but no longer works as intended. Without a structured workflow enforcing a deliberate step-by-step process, agents treat rebase as a mechanical operation rather than a reasoning task.

**Things to hash out:**
- What are the required checkpoint steps? At minimum: read both sides of each conflict before resolving, verify the intended behavior from each side is preserved in the resolution, run build+tests after each file resolved, final diff review before push.
- Should the workflow handle interactive rebase (reordering/squashing commits) or only conflict resolution, or both?
- How does the workflow detect when a "conflict-free" rebase silently loses semantic correctness (e.g. a function is moved on one branch and modified on the other, no textual conflict but wrong behavior)?

### Pluggable output delivery: workflows produce structured artifacts, delivery is configured externally (May 19, 2026)

**Status: partial** | Phases 1-7 shipped (PRs #1054, #1055, #1062-#1063, #1065, #1067, May 20 2026); delivery adapter architecture refactored (PR #1072 open); needs verification + Phase 8 gaps remain

**Score: 12** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**What shipped (Phases 1-7 + architecture refactor):**
- `DeliveryAdapter<K>` generic interface, `AdapterConfig` discriminated union, `DeliveryConfig` (source: 'explicit'|'synthesized'), `CliInboxAdapter`
- `synthesizeDeliveryConfig()` migration shim; `_runDeliveryByKind()` unified delivery dispatch (exhaustive switch, `assertNever`)
- `delivery: { kind: github_draft_review, token: $TOKEN, login: user }` YAML block replacing legacy `reviewerIdentity`
- Inline review comments posted to PR diff for findings with `file`+`startLine` fields
- Gate resume: `PendingDraftReviewPoller` calls `resumeFromGate()` fire-and-forget when operator submits review
- `PendingDeliverySidecar` discriminated union per `adapterId` (typed state, no unsafe casts in recovery)
- `PendingDeliverySidecar` types extracted to `pending-delivery-sidecar.ts`
- `GitHubDraftReviewAdapter` and `GitCommitAdapter` as proper `implements DeliveryAdapter<K>` classes (PR #1072 open)
- `GateResumeCallback` named type, injected at construction, threaded into `recoverPendingDeliveryPollers` so gate sessions resume after daemon restart
- `reviewerIdentity` fully removed; `callbackUrl` unified; `triggers.yml` migrated
- Full design doc at `docs/plans/output-delivery-design.md`; architecture refactor design at `docs/plans/output-delivery-design.md`

**Needs verification before declaring fully production-ready:**
- End-to-end test: fire a real `wr.mr-review` session with `delivery: { kind: github_draft_review }` in triggers.yml (no reviewerIdentity) and confirm draft review posts, inline comments appear, and gate resumes when operator submits
- Manual verification that `recoverPendingDeliveryPollers()` correctly restarts pollers after daemon crash
- Philosophical alignment audit: ensure the `DeliveryAdapter` layer boundary (trigger/ not daemon/) holds for all new code; verify `source: 'explicit'|'synthesized'` discriminant is used only where intended and not leaking as a gate for unrelated decisions
- Code verification: confirm `writePendingDeliverySidecar()` is called at every review posting site (not just one)

**Known remaining gaps (Phase 8+):**
- `dispatch()` path delivery (programmatic sessions don't get delivery notifications)
- Slack/GitLab adapters
- Event-sourced delivery bus (C3 from design doc) for full auditability
- `callbackUrl` still fires through separate `runCallbackUrlDelivery()` path rather than `_runDeliveryByKind()`
- `worktrain trigger validate` doesn't yet show resolved delivery adapter per trigger
- Shared `OutboxMessage` type extraction (duplicated between `CliInboxAdapter` and `worktrain-inbox.ts`)

### spawn_agent task worker mode: workflowId-less bounded task spawning (May 21, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

`spawn_agent` currently requires a `workflowId`, which forces all child sessions into a workflow container even when the child's job is simply "execute this bounded task and return findings." This is architecturally wrong: it makes illegal states representable (a reviewer family that re-runs the full parent workflow), it uses stringly-typed context (no compile-time enforcement that `reviewFactPacket` has the required fields), and it violates the principle that types must constrain not just label.

The proper architecture is a `taskWorker` mode on `spawn_agent`: spawn a bare agent session with goal + tools + typed context contract, runs until `end_turn`, parent reads findings from the final assistant message. No workflow, no `complete_step`, no phases. The task worker terminates naturally when its work is done.

**Current shim:** `wr.routine-reviewer-family` is a 1-step workflow that approximates this behavior. It is explicitly marked as a temporary shim in its description. It should be replaced when this item ships.

**What the proper design requires:**
- `spawn_agent` gains a `mode: 'task_worker'` field (or workflowId becomes optional)
- A typed `taskContext` schema replaces the free-form `context: Record<string, unknown>` for task worker spawns
- The engine validates `taskContext` against the declared schema at spawn time (validate at boundaries)
- The parent reads the child's final message as the task result -- no artifacts, no outputContract
- Cancellation propagates: if the parent is aborted, task worker children are also aborted

**Prerequisite for:** coordinator-intercepted delegation (above), proper reviewer family implementation, any future bounded task delegation pattern.

### Per-role model configuration: different models for different session roles (May 21, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 12** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Child sessions spawned via `spawn_agent` currently inherit no model configuration from the parent trigger -- they fall through to the default Bedrock model (`us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`), which may differ from the parent's intended model. More broadly, different roles in a pipeline have genuinely different model requirements: a reviewer family doing targeted code analysis benefits from a capable model; a gate evaluator doing a simple verdict check could use a cheaper/faster model; a coordinator deciding routing needs deterministic behavior more than raw capability.

There is no way today to say "use Haiku for sub-agents, Sonnet for the main agent" or "use Sonnet for review, Haiku for gate evaluation." All sessions in a pipeline use whichever model was configured on the trigger (for root sessions) or the default (for child sessions).

**Things to hash out:**
- Where does model config live for child sessions? Options: (a) spawn_agent spec includes a model field the spawner can set; (b) workflow author declares a `agentModel` at the step level for steps that spawn; (c) a workspace-level role mapping (`{ "reviewer": "haiku", "main": "sonnet", "gate_eval": "haiku" }`) that the daemon uses to resolve models by session role
- Is this a trigger concern (configure per-trigger which model each spawned role uses) or a workflow concern (workflow declares model requirements per step)?
- How does this interact with ProviderConfig DU (above) -- ideally they compose cleanly

### Migrate daemon subprocess handling to Bun (May 21, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The daemon (`src/daemon/`) uses Node's `child_process.exec()` for all subprocess execution. Node's `exec()` types don't support the `stdio` option, requiring `as any` casts throughout. Bun's `Bun.spawn()` provides a cleaner lower-level API with native TypeScript types, direct stream access, and clean AbortSignal support -- no type casting hacks needed.

Beyond correctness, Bun is faster at startup and file I/O, which matters for a daemon that creates worktrees, reads many files, and spawns many processes per session. Bun also has native TypeScript support, eliminating the `tsc` build step for the daemon.

**Scope:** The daemon (`src/daemon/`) is the natural migration target first -- it's where subprocess handling matters most and is relatively self-contained. The MCP server, console, and CLI could remain on Node initially.

**Things to hash out:**
- Which npm packages used by the daemon have Bun compatibility gaps, if any?
- Does vitest (the test runner) need changes to test Bun-native code?
- Does the `npm run dev:daemon` dev loop change with Bun (no `tsc` needed)?
- What's the right migration boundary -- daemon only, or full codebase?

### ProviderConfig: first-class LLM provider concept with interchangeable providers (May 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 14** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain has no first-class LLM provider concept. Credentials are threaded as a raw `apiKey: string` parameter through 9 call sites (trigger-listener -> TriggerRouter -> runWorkflow -> startup-recovery -> gate-resume -> buildAgentReadySession -> constructTools -> spawn-agent -> buildPreAgentSession -> buildAgentClient), but `buildAgentClient` is the ONLY consumer. All other sites are pure pass-through couriers. The immediate symptom -- daemon fails to start with `missing_api_key` when only Bedrock credentials are present -- was patched with a `hasBedrock` guard, but the underlying threading antipattern remains. Without a typed ProviderConfig concept, adding a new provider (Ollama, Vertex, OpenAI) requires changing if-branches in a single growing function rather than adding a new variant to a discriminated union.

**The right architecture:** `ProviderConfig = { kind: 'anthropic'; apiKey: string } | { kind: 'bedrock' } | { kind: 'ollama'; baseUrl: string }` resolved once at the composition root (`startTriggerListener`). `buildAgentClient(providerConfig, trigger)` becomes the sole construction site with `Result<{agentClient, modelId}, ProviderError>` return type (no throw). The `apiKey: string | undefined` parameter is deleted from all 9 call sites. New providers plug in by adding a union variant -- exhaustiveness checking enforces that all switch sites handle the new case. This also provides a natural anchor for Bedrock credential expiry detection (backlog score 14).

**Design doc:** `docs/plans/provider-config-design.md` (completed May 20, 2026). Selected direction is the ProviderConfig DU after `wr.discovery` session. Full rationale, rejected alternatives, and implementation constraints are documented there.

**Upgrade trigger from current patch:** When Bedrock credential expiry detection (this backlog) is scoped, check if it needs a stateful refreshable credential handle. If yes, implement ProviderConfig DU at that time. If Ollama support is being built first, ProviderConfig DU is required as a prerequisite (Ollama needs a `baseUrl` that doesn't come from env).

**Things to hash out:**
- When `agentConfig.model` specifies a provider prefix (e.g. `anthropic/claude-opus`) but only Bedrock creds are present, should `buildAgentClient` fail fast with a clear error or fall back to Bedrock with the model stripped of its prefix?
- Should ProviderConfig be resolved from `config.json` (operator-declared default) or purely from env detection? `config.json` gives better startup observability but adds schema complexity.

### Local LLM support: use Gemma, Llama, or any Ollama-compatible model as the agent backend (May 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: yes (needs ProviderConfig DU above)

WorkTrain currently supports two backends: Anthropic direct (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and Amazon Bedrock (`AWS_PROFILE`). Both are cloud APIs with per-token costs, rate limits, and latency. A local LLM backend would enable: offline operation, zero API cost for iteration and testing, privacy for sensitive codebases, and much faster iteration cycles on workflow development.

**What this looks like:** `agentConfig.model: "ollama/llama3.2"` or `agentConfig.model: "ollama/gemma3:4b"` in triggers.yml. The daemon detects the `ollama/` prefix, constructs an Ollama-compatible HTTP client, and uses it as the `AgentClientInterface` instead of `AnthropicBedrock` or `Anthropic`.

**Implementation path:** `AgentClientInterface` in `agent-loop.ts` is already duck-typed -- it only requires `messages.create(params, options)` returning `Promise<Anthropic.Message>`. Ollama's `/api/chat` endpoint with `stream: false` can be wrapped in a thin adapter that maps to this interface. The key translation: Ollama uses OpenAI-style tool calling format, not Anthropic's `tool_use` content blocks -- the adapter needs to normalize this.

**Where it fits:** Requires ProviderConfig DU (item above) as a prerequisite -- Ollama needs a `baseUrl` that is not an env var, making it structurally incompatible with the current env-read-only approach in `buildAgentClient`. Once ProviderConfig DU ships, adding Ollama is one new union variant + one new class implementing `AgentClientInterface`.

**Things to hash out:**
- Ollama tool calling quality varies significantly by model -- Llama 3.2 and Gemma 3 support tool use but reliability is lower than Claude. How does WorkTrain handle an agent that frequently hallucinates tool names or ignores tool results?
- Context window size: local models typically have 4K-8K context vs. Claude's 200K. Long `wr.mr-review` sessions that read many files may hit the limit mid-session. Need a warning or graceful degradation when context is near capacity.
- The `stallTimeoutSeconds` default (120s) is calibrated for Claude response times. Local models on consumer hardware can be much slower or much faster -- the default should be overridable and local models may need a higher default.

### worktrain session events: readable turn-by-turn replay of any session (May 15, 2026)

**Score: 16** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:3 Lev:3 Con:4 | Blocked: no

We have never successfully completed a full end-to-end autonomous `wr.mr-review` run that reaches the gate, posts a draft review, and completes after the operator publishes it.

**Root causes cleared (May 2026):**
- ~~Engine misdirects agents on artifact failures~~ -- fixed PR #1079 (blocked-messages registry, wrong-kind detection)
- ~~`wr.mr-review` reviewer families spawn full child review sessions~~ -- fixed PR #1084 (bounded `wr.routine-reviewer-family` shim)

- ~~human_approval gate fires before draft is posted~~ -- not true, gate fires AFTER draft posts; gate removed as prerequisite to draft posting (PR #1081 conditional gate, fires only for non-clean verdicts)

**What the gate now does (as of PR #1081/1084):**
- `recommendation == 'clean'` → session completes autonomously, draft posts via delivery adapter, no gate
- `recommendation != 'clean'` (minor/blocking) → gate fires, draft posts, session waits for operator to publish draft

**What still needs to happen:**
1. `wr.mr-review` session runs to completion on a real PR (reaches phase-6)
2. Draft review posts to GitHub via `GitHubReviewApprovalAdapter`
3. For non-clean verdict: `PendingDraftReviewPoller` detects operator submission within 60s, session resumes and completes

**Remaining concerns:**
- `wr.routine-reviewer-family` is a shim -- reviewer families run 1-step but context is free-form (see `spawn_agent task worker mode` backlog item)
- `paused_at_gate` coordinator fix: `fetchChildSessionResult` still returns `kind: 'success'` for both `complete` and `paused_at_gate` -- only `awaitSessions` distinguishes them at the outcome level. Not blocking for MVP but a latent type ambiguity.

**Success signal:** real pending draft review visible on GitHub, with findings. Operator publishes it, session completes, `session_completed` event in logs.

### Large-comment smell detection during implementation (May 8, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

When an implementing agent adds a large comment to explain a code decision, that comment is often a signal that the architecture is wrong -- the agent is explaining a workaround rather than fixing the underlying constraint. There is currently no mechanism in the pipeline to detect this pattern and force the agent to investigate whether the comment reflects a design problem. Agents tend to either leave large comments in place or delete them silently; neither response surfaces the underlying architectural question.

**Things to hash out:**
- What heuristic defines a "large" comment worth flagging? The right threshold is unknown -- too sensitive produces noise, too coarse misses real smells.
- Where in the pipeline should detection happen -- during implementation, post-implementation, or as part of review?
- Who is responsible for detection: the agent itself, the coordinator, or the reviewer? Each has different visibility and different trust levels.
- What is the right response when a smell is detected -- inject an extra step, block advancement, emit a signal, or something else entirely? One rough candidate: a coordinator-side script that diffs the working tree, scans for large newly-added comment blocks, and injects an additional verification step into the active session when it finds them -- but this is completely untested thinking, take with a large grain of salt.
- How does the agent distinguish a comment explaining a non-obvious invariant (legitimate) from one explaining a workaround (smell)? This may require LLM judgment, not just pattern matching.

### Richer PR context pre-assembly: inject diff, description, commits, and linked ticket before first turn (May 21, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:3 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The `context-assembly` subsystem already runs before the first LLM turn and injects a `## Prior Context` section into the system prompt. For `pr_review` tasks, it currently fetches only a file list (`gh pr diff --name-only`) and prior session notes. The agent must spend turns fetching the actual diff content, PR description, linked issues, and commit history itself -- work that deterministic scripts could do in under a second before the session starts.

**What to add to `context-assembly/index.ts` for `pr_review` tasks:**

- **Full diff** (`gh pr diff <n>`) -- the actual changed lines, not just filenames. Truncate to a budget (e.g. 50KB) if large; include a note when truncated. This is the single highest-value addition: the agent currently reads individual files to reconstruct what the diff is doing.
- **PR description + body** (`gh pr view <n> --json title,body,labels,milestone,state`) -- acceptance criteria and intent live here.
- **Linked issues** (`gh pr view <n> --json closingIssuesReferences`) -- follows "closes #N" references and fetches issue body. One level deep only.
- **Commit list with messages** (`gh pr view <n> --json commits`) -- author intent is often clearer in commit messages than in the diff.
- **Existing review comments** (`gh pr view <n> --json reviews,comments`) -- prior reviewer feedback and author responses. Only relevant for re-review sessions.

**Where it fits:** `assembleGitDiff()` in `src/context-assembly/index.ts` already has the `pr_review` branch with the `gh` CLI call. Expanding it and adding sibling functions follows the existing pattern. The `renderContextBundle()` function adds rendered sections to the system prompt.

**Implementation notes:**
- All fetches should be parallel (`Promise.all`) with individual timeouts and graceful fallback on failure
- The total injected context budget matters -- full diffs can be large. Use `gh pr diff --stat` as a summary fallback when diff exceeds budget
- `contextMapping` in `triggers.yml` already passes `itemNumber: "$.pull_request.number"` -- no trigger config changes needed

**Things to hash out:**
- What's the right budget for full diff injection? 50KB covers most PRs; very large diffs need truncation with a clear note
- Should linked issue fetch be depth-1 only, or follow issue->epic->spec chains?
- For re-review sessions, how do we distinguish first review (no prior comments relevant) from re-review (prior comments are primary context)?

### MemoryStore: indexed session history as a coordinator and enricher dependency (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs universal enricher first)

The session event log is rich -- it records goals, step notes, artifacts, delivered commits, git state, and phase handoffs. But querying it requires a full directory scan and per-session event projection on every call. `LocalSessionSummaryProviderV2` does this today and is used in exactly one place (the PR-review coordinator). Every other consumer either skips it or re-implements a slower version.

**Design:** A `MemoryStore` port backed by `~/.workrail/memory.db` (SQLite, WAL mode), indexed by `finalizeSession()` as fire-and-forget after each session completes. Replaces the current full directory scan with an indexed query -- O(log n + k) for "recent sessions for this workspace" instead of O(n) full scan. Query kinds v1: `recent_sessions` (workspace-scoped, indexed on `(workspace_hash, completed_at DESC)`), `sessions_by_goal_keywords` (requires full-text index or O(n) scan). Consumed by the WorkflowEnricher and coordinator pre-dispatch paths, not by agents directly.

**Why not a mid-session agent tool:** context assembly belongs in the layer that dispatches the session -- the coordinator and enricher know what workspace they're spawning into and can assemble context deterministically before the first turn. Leaving retrieval to the agent requires the LLM to make a judgment call about its own context needs mid-session, burns turns, and produces inconsistent results. If an agent needs something that wasn't pre-loaded, that's a gap in the assembly step, not a signal to give agents a retrieval tool.

Phase 2b (separate): index phase artifacts via a new `phase_artifact_appended` session event kind -- bridges the PipelineRunContext silo into the session event log. Requires engine schema review.

**Things to hash out:**
- SQLite native compilation may fail in some environments (Docker, Alpine). Mitigation: `@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm` (pure WASM) or make MemoryStore fully optional -- daemon works without it, enricher falls back to the slow scan.
- `sessions_by_goal_keywords` without a full-text index is still O(n). Is keyword search needed in v1, or is recency-scoped `recent_sessions` sufficient to start?
- `phase_artifact_appended` schema change: new event kind vs reuse existing artifact channel with new content type. Different backward-compatibility implications -- needs engine team input before Phase 2b starts.
- **The ideal vs achievable tension:** ideally all context is assembled before the first turn and the agent never has to fetch more. Whether that's achievable depends on whether the relevant context is predictable from the trigger payload. For structured tasks (PR review, known issue) it usually is. For open-ended discovery or tasks with ambiguous scope, the needed context only becomes clear as the agent reads code -- you can't fully front-load it. One candidate: a context-gathering sub-agent spawned before the main session that reads the workspace and returns a structured context bundle to the coordinator, which then assembles it into the main session's pre-load. This has its own issues: it adds latency (a full extra session before the real work starts), risks gathering the wrong things (the sub-agent doesn't know what the main agent will need), and may just push the "what context do I need?" judgment to an earlier LLM call rather than eliminating it. Worth tracking as a design direction before deciding whether to invest in mid-session retrieval infrastructure at all.

### worktrain session analyze: verify agents actually use pre-loaded context (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

There is no way to verify whether agents actually use pre-loaded context (soul, workspace context, `assembledContextSummary`, session notes) in their reasoning. The entire memory architecture investment (universal enricher, MemoryStore, knowledge graph) assumes agents reference pre-loaded context at turn 1 -- but this assumption is unvalidated. If agents receive 32KB of workspace context and `assembledContextSummary` but don't cite them in their reasoning before acting, richer pre-loading adds token cost without improving outcomes.

Today, validating this requires manually reading raw session transcripts, which is impractical at scale. A `worktrain session analyze <sessionId>` command that reads the agent turn events and reports whether any pre-loaded context fields were cited in turn-1 reasoning would make this automatable and support data-driven decisions about context loading investment.

**Done looks like:** `worktrain session analyze <sessionId>` reads the session event log, extracts turn-1 assistant message content, checks for citations of injected fields (workspace context file names, goal text, prior step note content), and reports a structured summary: fields injected, fields cited, fields ignored.

**Things to hash out:**
- "Citation" is hard to define precisely -- the agent might paraphrase rather than quote. Does substring matching suffice, or does this need an LLM similarity check?
- Should this be a CLI command or a console feature? The console already reads session data; this could be a "context audit" view.
- The primary use case is a one-time validation gate (before shipping the universal enricher). Does this justify a permanent command, or is it a one-off script?

### Operator preference memory: WorkTrain learns and retains operator-specific preferences (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain runs fully autonomously but has no persistent memory of operator preferences -- things like "always squash before merging", "don't open PRs without a linked issue", "prefer functional patterns in new files", or "this workspace uses tabs not spaces." Every session starts from the same generic `daemon-soul.md` baseline. Preferences discovered or stated in one session don't carry forward.

Claude Code solves this for human-in-the-loop sessions via its memory system (feedback, user, project entries written by the AI mid-conversation). WorkTrain needs an equivalent, but the mechanism is fundamentally different because: (a) there is no human watching the session to correct or confirm, and (b) opening up an interactive channel into an autonomous pipeline introduces risk that has to be carefully scoped.

Candidate input mechanisms (not mutually exclusive):

1. **MR/PR review comments** -- when a human reviewer requests changes or comments on a WorkTrain PR, that signal is authoritative feedback. WorkTrain already monitors PRs post-review (see backlog entry on root cause analysis). Extracting preference-relevant comments ("always add a test for this pattern", "don't use this API directly") and persisting them is a natural extension.

2. **`worktrain tell`** -- the existing CLI command queues a message to the daemon. Could be extended to a `worktrain remember "..."` variant that writes directly to a workspace-scoped preferences store, bypassing the session queue entirely.

3. **Explicit preference file** -- a `~/.workrail/operator-preferences.md` (or per-workspace variant) that the operator edits directly, injected into every session alongside `daemon-soul.md`. Lower friction than building a learning mechanism; higher friction than automatic inference.

4. **Inferred from repeated corrections** -- if WorkTrain makes the same kind of mistake N times across sessions (same type of review finding, same escalation reason), automatically surface a draft preference for operator approval before persisting.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the storage format -- append-only structured log, a single evolving markdown file, or a SQLite table? The answer affects how preferences are queried and how conflicts between preferences are resolved.
- How does a persisted preference get *removed or updated*? Stale preferences can be worse than none -- "always use library X" becomes harmful when X is deprecated.
- What is the trust model for inferred preferences vs explicitly stated ones? A preference extracted from a PR comment should carry different weight than one inferred from repeated behavior.
- Does this interact with `daemon-soul.md`? Soul covers behavioral philosophy; preferences cover workspace/operator-specific constraints. They're different concerns but both end up in the system prompt -- precedence and load order matter.
- The fully-closed-pipeline concern is real: mechanisms 1 and 4 operate without human intervention during sessions, which is the correct design. Mechanism 2 requires the operator to pull a lever (acceptable). Mechanism 3 is fully manual (always safe). Any mechanism that *pauses a session mid-run to ask a question* would break the autonomous contract and should not be explored here.

### Per-run retrospective: structured learning from pipeline outcomes (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

After a pipeline run completes -- whether it merged, escalated, or failed -- there is no structured mechanism for WorkTrain to record what it learned. Mistakes that occurred in one run (wrong interpretation, missed edge case, collateral damage rationalized as a tradeoff) are not surfaced to future sessions. Each run starts with the same baseline.

A per-run retrospective is a lightweight post-completion step that answers: what went wrong or unexpectedly, what assumption turned out to be false, what should the next session starting on this codebase know that this session didn't? The output would be a structured record written to the session store and made available as Tier 0 context for future sessions on the same workspace.

This is distinct from the per-step `report_issue` mechanism (which records obstacles mid-session) and from the `wr.coding-task` phase-8 retrospective workflow (which is an agent-facing step prompt). This is a coordinator-level mechanism that runs after the pipeline exits, regardless of which workflows ran.

**Things to hash out:**
- Who runs the retrospective -- the coordinator (deterministic, reads phase results and produces structured output), a lightweight LLM step, or the agent in a final workflow phase?
- What is the output format? A structured `RetrospectiveArtifactV1` that feeds Tier 0 context injection, or freeform notes that accumulate in a `workspace-knowledge.md` file?
- Where does the output live? Per-run (alongside `PipelineRunContext`), per-workspace (accumulated knowledge store), or per-session in the session store?
- When a retrospective records "assumption X was wrong," how does that fact reach future sessions? It needs to be injected as Tier 0 context -- which requires the context loading path to know where to look.
- Should the retrospective run on every pipeline outcome (merge, escalate, timeout, error), or only on non-merge outcomes where something went wrong?

### Phase quality gate policy: partial vs escalate (May 5, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The current phase quality gate policy (implemented in living work context, PR #939) is: `fallback` → escalate, `partial` → proceed with warning, `full` → proceed normally. The `partial` path is a deliberate judgment call that favors progress over quality: the agent ran for 25-65 minutes and produced partial output, and retrying might also produce partial output.

The open question: should `partial` also escalate, or is "proceed with warning" the right default? This requires observability data to answer. If `partial` phases regularly produce wrong downstream output (review catches issues caused by missing upstream context, fix loops triggered by context gaps), the policy should shift to escalate-on-partial. If `partial` phases produce acceptable output, the current policy is correct.

**Things to hash out:**
- What metric determines whether `partial` downstream output is "wrong enough" to justify policy change? Review findings that cite missing upstream context? Fix loop iteration count?
- Should the policy be configurable per-trigger (some pipelines tolerate partial, others don't)?
- Should the `partial` warning in `assembledContextSummary` be structured enough that the downstream agent can flag "I was working with incomplete context" in its handoff artifact, making the degradation chain traceable?
- Is there a smarter policy -- e.g. retry the prior phase once before escalating?

**Note:** This is not a correctness problem with the current implementation. `fallback` correctly escalates. `partial` correctly proceeds with an explicit warning. The question is whether the `partial` threshold is in the right place. Revisit after observing real pipeline runs.

### MR review: check class placement and responsibility scope of changed code (May 13, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The MR review workflow checks whether code is correct, but it does not currently check whether new code belongs where it was placed. An agent can write a method that works correctly but was added to the wrong class, or to a class that is growing too large and acquiring too many responsibilities. These placement issues pass correctness review and only surface later when the class becomes unmaintainable.

Two specific checks are missing today:
1. **Class fit**: does the added code truly belong to the class it was placed in, or should it be extracted into a different class, a standalone function, or a different module? The reviewer should flag cases where new methods don't match the class's stated purpose or require access to state the class doesn't own.
2. **Class size and responsibility creep**: if the class receiving new code is already large (e.g. 500+ lines, 15+ public methods) or has multiple unrelated concerns, the review should surface this. The coding agent's work may be locally correct but may be the wrong place to add it.

The coordinator-deps.ts refactor session (May 13, 2026) is a concrete example: the class reached 834 lines and mixed session-reading, session-spawning, and infrastructure before the issue was caught in a separate review pass rather than at PR time.

**Things to hash out:**
- What heuristics define "wrong class"? The step prompt needs concrete signals: does the method access state the class doesn't own? Does it duplicate capability that exists elsewhere? Does it have no cohesion with the class's other methods?
- How does the reviewer distinguish "correct placement but class needs refactoring" (scope of current PR) from "wrong placement" (should have gone elsewhere)?
- What is the output contract? A finding with findingCategory='architecture' pointing to the specific method and the suggested alternative location?
- Should this be a new reviewer family in Phase 3 or an addition to an existing family (e.g. `patterns_architecture`)?

### Slack/Teams/chat integration for pipeline completion alerts (May 4, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

When WorkTrain completes a pipeline run -- whether it produced a PR, escalated, timed out, or failed -- the operator currently has no push notification. They have to poll the console or check their email. For overnight-safe autonomous operation (the vision's stated success condition), the operator needs to know when work is ready for their attention without having to check. Beyond the individual operator, the team that will review the PR also needs to know it exists and is ready. Neither is addressed today.

The use case has two layers: (1) operator-facing -- "your pipeline finished, here's the PR URL and outcome summary," sent to the operator's Slack/Teams DM or a dedicated channel; (2) team-facing -- "a PR is ready for review," sent to the team's review channel with enough context for a reviewer to triage without navigating to GitHub.

**Things to hash out:**
- Is this a WorkTrain daemon concern (coordinator sends notification after pipeline completion) or a trigger-layer concern (configured alongside the trigger)? The `callbackUrl` mechanism already exists for HTTP POST on completion -- is Slack/Teams just a specialized callback, or does it need first-class support?
- What is the configuration model? Per-trigger (`notifyOnComplete: { slack: { channel: "#pr-reviews", token: "$SLACK_TOKEN" } }`) or workspace-level (`~/.workrail/config.json`)?
- How does the team-facing notification avoid becoming noise? If WorkTrain opens 10 PRs in a day, each triggering a Slack message, the channel becomes unusable. Is there a batching, threading, or filtering mechanism?
- What is the authentication and secret management story? Same `$ENV_VAR_NAME` resolution as trigger HMAC secrets, or a separate credentials store?

### Daemon working hours and dispatch scheduling (May 4, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain is designed for overnight-safe autonomous operation, but "overnight-safe" currently means the daemon keeps working through the night without human oversight -- not that it respects the operator's or team's working hours. A PR opened at 2am sits unreviewed until morning. Slack/Teams notifications at 3am are noise. Triggers that fire from monitoring alerts at midnight might not be appropriate to dispatch.

There is no current mechanism to configure when the daemon dispatches new sessions, when it sends notifications, or when it holds work for the next business day.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the scope? Working hours could affect: (a) trigger dispatch (hold incoming triggers until working hours), (b) notifications (send alerts only during working hours), (c) both. These may need separate configuration.
- What is the configuration model? Per-workspace (`~/.workrail/config.json: { workingHours: { timezone: "America/New_York", days: ["Mon"-"Fri"], start: "09:00", end: "18:00" } }`) or per-trigger (some triggers are critical and should dispatch any time)?
- How does "critical" work? An on-call incident trigger probably should not be gated by working hours. What is the mechanism for a trigger to opt out? A `priority: critical` flag, or explicit `ignoreWorkingHours: true`?
- What happens to triggers that fire outside working hours? Queue and dispatch at next working-hours start, discard, or dispatch anyway but suppress notifications?
- How does this interact with multi-timezone teams?

### Assumption resolution before acting: agents should fill information gaps with available tools (May 4, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 11** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:1 | Blocked: no

Pipeline agents currently have two options when they hit an information gap: proceed with an explicit assumption, or get stuck. Neither is optimal. The coding agent might assume a function signature, proceed with the wrong implementation, and only discover the error in review. Any phase agent might miss context that was resolvable with a two-second tool call (gh, glab, jira, glean, codebase search, MCP tools). There is currently no structured mechanism in the workflow engine or in individual workflows that asks agents to explicitly audit their open assumptions and use available tools to close them before committing to an approach.

**Things to hash out:**
- Is this a workflow-level concern (each workflow author decides when and where to add assumption resolution) or an engine-level concern (the engine injects it automatically)?
- Is the right mechanism a routine (injected via `templateCall`, creating a visible dedicated step with notes output), a feature (engine-injected constraint on every step), or both?
- Should assumption resolution happen once per workflow (front-loaded as the first step) or opportunistically (at any step where the agent identifies a gap)?
- What tools should the agent be expected to use? The set varies by workspace (some have Jira, some have GitLab, some have Glean). A generic routine can only say "use whatever tools are available" -- is that specific enough to be useful?
- How does this interact with the task-scoped rules idea and the ephemeral per-turn injection idea? All three are trying to get the right context to the agent at the right time.

### Intent gap: agent builds what it understood, not what the user meant (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

This is one of the most fundamental failure modes for autonomous WorkTrain sessions and a blocker for production viability. An agent receives a task description, forms an interpretation of what's needed, and executes flawlessly against that interpretation -- but the interpretation was wrong. The code is correct for what the agent thought was asked. It is not what the user actually wanted. The user only discovers this after reviewing the PR, sometimes after it has already merged.

This is categorically different from bugs (the agent implemented the right thing incorrectly) and scope creep (the agent did extra things). This is the agent solving the wrong problem well.

**Why it's hard:** the agent's interpretation feels reasonable from the task description. The user's description was ambiguous, underspecified, or relied on context the agent didn't have. Neither party made an obvious mistake -- the gap is structural.

**Known manifestations:**
- Agent fixes the symptom instead of the root cause because the task description named the symptom
- Agent implements feature X when the user wanted feature Y that happens to use X
- Agent interprets "add support for Z" as extending the existing system when the user wanted a new abstraction
- Agent makes a local fix when the user wanted an architectural change
- Agent's implementation is technically correct but violates unstated invariants the user assumed were obvious

**Done looks like:** a WorkTrain session that receives an ambiguous or underspecified task either (a) states its interpretation explicitly before acting and the coordinator can gate on approval, or (b) has access to enough prior context (from the knowledge graph or living work context) that the interpretation is reliably correct. A session that builds the wrong thing well should be detectable before it merges, not after.

**Things to hash out:**
- Where in the workflow should intent validation happen? Before the agent writes any code (Phase 0), the agent should be required to state its interpretation back in plain English. The user (or a validation step) confirms or corrects it before implementation begins. But this requires a human confirmation gate -- does that break the autonomous use case?
- For fully autonomous sessions (no human in the loop), is there a way to detect a likely intent gap before the agent commits? Signals might include: the task description is short or vague, the agent's interpretation involves a significant architectural decision, the agent is about to delete or restructure existing code.
- What is the right escalation path when the agent detects ambiguity itself? Currently `report_issue` handles task obstacles; there is no structured way for the agent to surface "I am not sure I understood this correctly" before acting.
- The `wr.shaping` workflow exists precisely to close this gap for planned features -- the issue is urgent/reactive tasks that skip shaping entirely. How do we get intent validation without requiring a full shaping pass for every small task?
- Can historical session notes help? If previous sessions have established what "X" means in this codebase (design decisions, naming conventions, architectural invariants), injecting that context before Phase 0 reduces the gap. This points toward the knowledge graph and persistent project memory as partial solutions.
- Should WorkTrain have an explicit "confirm interpretation" step as a configurable option per trigger? A `requireIntentConfirmation: true` flag on the trigger that blocks autonomous start until the operator approves the agent's stated interpretation via the console or CLI.

### Intent resolution: tiered context harvest to close the intent gap before coding starts (May 4, 2026)

**Status: designing -- not ready for shaping or implementation** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The intent gap entry names the failure mode. This entry is the resolution design. The root cause is not that agents misread tickets -- it is that agents form interpretations without access to the context that would resolve ambiguity. The fix is a structured, tiered context harvest during discovery, a mid-discovery interpretation checkpoint, and a configurable escalation ladder when ambiguity survives the harvest.

**The core insight:** a ticket description is almost never the most authoritative source of intent. The epic it belongs to, the design doc it references, the Slack thread where the feature was scoped, the vision doc that defines what the project is trying to become -- these carry far more signal. An agent that only reads the ticket is working with the thinnest slice of available context. Importantly, none of these sources need to live in the codebase -- they can be in Confluence, Notion, Slack, Google Docs, or a GitHub wiki. The tool layer is the access mechanism regardless of where the content lives.

**Two distinct failure subtypes -- require different responses:**

Research (AmbiEval 2026, Orchid 2026, AskBench 2026) distinguishes two failure modes:
- **Subtype A -- vagueness/ambiguity:** the ticket is underspecified or has multiple valid interpretations. "Delete the record" -- soft-delete or hard-delete? The tiered harvest + council addresses this.
- **Subtype B -- wrong prior:** the ticket is clear, but the agent has a systematically wrong prior about what tickets like this mean in this codebase. "Fix the auth issue" -- agent knows what auth issues usually mean, but this codebase does it differently. No amount of context harvest resolves this; it requires challenging the agent's assumptions explicitly.

**Critical decision before building: measure which subtype dominates your actual failure distribution.** Retrospectively classify 10-20 past wrong-implementation cases as Subtype A vs B. If Subtype B is significant, the council and detection scaffold are insufficient -- Subtype B requires assumption-logging and adversarial plan review, not just ambiguity detection. The entire design below addresses Subtype A well and Subtype B only partially.

**Tiered context harvest:**

Tier 0 -- project identity (always injected, not searched):
- Vision doc, active backlog items, design locks/ADRs for the affected area, coding philosophy
- Not searched for relevance -- injected unconditionally because they constrain every interpretation
- Source locations are workspace-configured and can be anywhere: local files (`docs/vision.md`), Confluence, Notion, Google Docs, GitHub wiki -- resolved via the same tool layer as other tiers
- `ContextLoader` resolves Tier 0 sources before session start using whatever tools the workspace has configured
- If Tier 0 is empty (no project identity configured), the minimum `ambiguityLevel` floor is `'uncertain'` regardless of agent self-report

Tier 1 -- structured task sources (highest signal, deterministic):
- Jira/Linear: linked epics, acceptance criteria, parent ticket, comments, attachments
- GitHub/GitLab: linked PRs, prior implementations of the same feature, commit history on affected files, related issues
- The ticket's own epic/milestone context -- a vague ticket is often disambiguated by the epic it belongs to

Tier 2 -- conversational sources (high signal, noisier):
- Slack: the thread where the ticket was discussed, the channel where the feature was scoped, off-ticket decisions
- Notion/Confluence/Google Docs: design docs linked in the ticket or epic, ADRs for the affected area
- Hard retrieval budget: top 2-3 most relevant sources, 4K token cap total. Beyond budget, sources logged as "available but not injected" and added to `unresolvedAssumptions[]`
- Conflict resolution: when a lower-tier source contradicts a higher-tier source, the higher tier wins and the contradiction surfaces in `unresolvedAssumptions[]`. Priority: Tier 0 ADRs > Tier 1 acceptance criteria > Tier 1 linked epic > Tier 2 design docs > Tier 2 Slack threads

Tier 3 -- codebase itself:
- How similar features were implemented previously
- Naming conventions, existing abstractions, patterns that constrain valid interpretations
- Tests that describe current behavior of the affected area

**"Enough context" checklist (harvest stops when satisfied, not when budget is full):**
1. Tier 0 was injected or confirmed unavailable
2. Tier 1 structured sources were queried (epic, acceptance criteria, linked issues)
3. If Tier 1 returned ambiguity-relevant signal, Tier 2 search attempted for the most specific query
4. Agent can articulate at least one rival interpretation with evidence

**Ticket quality pre-flight (lightweight, independent of the full harvest):**
Before dispatch, run 5 INVEST-based quality checks on the ticket: unambiguous, testable, non-compound, has acceptance criteria, scoped. USeR (arxiv 2503.02049) provides 34 automated RE quality metrics; these 5 are the highest-signal subset. Deployable independently of the full detection scaffold. A ticket that fails multiple quality checks is routed to Subtype A treatment immediately without spending turns on harvest.

**Tool graceful degradation:** tool failure never blocks session start. When a configured source is unreachable, log the error, treat as empty, include in `unresolvedAssumptions[]`, and elevate `ambiguityLevel` accordingly. When a tool is not configured, skip silently.

**Mid-discovery interpretation checkpoint:**

Not pre-discovery (too low signal) and not post-discovery (too expensive to correct). The right spot is early in discovery after the agent has read the file structure, recent git history, relevant modules, and harvested Tier 0-1 context. Roughly turns 3-5.

The checkpoint first classifies task type, then produces the interpretation artifact:

`taskType: 'targeted_fix' | 'feature' | 'refactor' | 'architectural'`
- `targeted_fix`: well-scoped, additive, low ambiguity risk -- council can be skipped
- `feature`: new behavior, moderate ambiguity risk
- `refactor`: structural change, high ambiguity risk
- `architectural`: systemic change -- always requires council, minimum `ambiguityLevel` is `'uncertain'`

Interpretation artifact:
- `interpretation`: "I understand this task as X"
- `rivalInterpretations[]`: genuine alternative readings -- must be architecturally different, not minor variations. Use falsification forcing: "What is the single most important word or phrase that, if read differently, leads to a substantially different implementation? Describe both implementations."
- `unresolvedAssumptions[]`: what would have to be true for the primary interpretation to be wrong
- `ambiguityLevel: 'clear' | 'uncertain' | 'ambiguous'` -- self-reported, used as floor only
- `confidenceBreakdown`: `{ tier0Injected, tier1Complete, tier2Retrieved, rivalInterpretationStrength: 'weak' | 'plausible' | 'strong', unresolvedAssumptionCount, overallAmbiguityLevel }`

**Add: clarification question generation as an independent signal.** Ask: "What is the one question you would most want answered before implementing this?" A specific high-stakes question ("Does 'delete' mean soft-delete or hard-delete?") = ambiguous. Inability to generate a meaningful question = likely clear. Specificity and number of non-trivial questions generated is an independent ambiguity meter (KC et al. 2025).

**Critical: self-reported ambiguity is untrustworthy.** RLHF trains models to provide confident, forward-moving responses (Sharma et al. 2023). Use `max(introspective, structural)` as the effective level:

Structural pre-filter signals (fast, no LLM, computed before checkpoint):
- Presence of weak modals ("should", "may"), vague quantifiers ("fast", "large"), passive without agent, undefined pronouns, no acceptance criteria -- RE literature, 70-89% precision on formal requirements
- `taskType` is `'architectural'` or `'refactor'`
- Tier 0 is empty
- `unresolvedAssumptionCount > 2`
- Tier 1 returned empty

Semantic entropy sampling (behavioral, no self-report):
Sample the interpretation step 5-7 times at temperature ~0.8. Cluster semantically equivalent outputs. Compute Shannon entropy over clusters. High entropy = model is generating genuinely different interpretations, independent of self-report. Well-established (Wang et al. ICLR 2023, Kuhn et al. ICLR 2023 Spotlight). Cost: ~6-8x single inference, fully parallelizable.

**Escalation ladder (coordinator routes deterministically on effective ambiguity level):**

1. `'clear'` → proceed to full discovery automatically
2. `'uncertain'` → council of agents (see below). Re-evaluate on council output.
3. Still `'uncertain'` after council + `requireIntentConfirmation: 'uncertain'` on trigger → structured clarification request to operator. Structured options: "A / B / proceed with best judgment / abandon" + default-if-no-reply timeout (e.g. 4 hours → proceed with A). Delivered via configured channel (Slack > webhook > console outbox). Correction injected as `steer`; agent re-orients mid-discovery without restarting.
4. `'ambiguous'` + `requireIntentConfirmation: 'always'` → pause for human approval.
5. Genuinely unanswerable → escalate to outbox with full context packet.

`requireIntentConfirmation: 'never' | 'uncertain' | 'always'` per trigger, defaulting to `'uncertain'`. Global workspace default overridable per trigger.

**Vagueness vs. ambiguity routing:**

- **Vague ticket** (underspecified -- doesn't say enough): clarification request to operator. Only the operator can add missing information. Council will not help -- both challengers fill the same gap the same way.
- **Ambiguous ticket** (multiple valid interpretations): council of agents, then operator if unresolved.

The detection layer classifies which failure mode before routing.

**Council of agents -- cross-family comparison, not same-model debate:**

The council handles ambiguous tickets. Its purpose is detecting interpretation error, not resolving genuine ambiguity (that requires the operator).

**Critical research findings:**
- "When Two LLMs Debate" (2025, 10-model study): both agents escalate to ~83% stated confidence by round 3 regardless of correctness. Never use stated confidence from a council -- compare interpretation content only.
- "Persona Collapse / Chameleon's Limit" (2026): same-model instances with different personas converge to a narrow behavioral mode regardless of role assignment. Role prompts do not produce genuinely independent populations.
- "Diversity of Thought in MAD" (2024): different model families achieve 91% vs 82% on reasoning benchmarks. Cross-family diversity reduces correlated interpretation errors.

**Cross-family model diversity is required for genuine independence.** Role assignment can be layered on top but cannot substitute for it.

The council is structured as comparison, not debate -- no "primary defends" turn:

1. Primary agent (model family A) submits interpretation artifact
2. Two challenger agents spawn in parallel from different model families (B, C), each with raw ticket + Tier 0-2 context but NOT the primary's interpretation. Each produces an independent reading.
3. Coordinator compares all three outputs for substantive semantic divergence.
4. Council produces typed output contract: `{ revisedAmbiguityLevel, failureMode: 'ambiguous' | 'vague', primaryInterpretationSurvived: boolean, winningInterpretation: { text, basis }, dissents[] }`
5. Coordinator routes on `revisedAmbiguityLevel` and `failureMode`. Zero LLM turns.

Challenger constraints:
- Hard `maxTurns` cap (10-15 each) -- each challenger has one job
- Spawned with `maxSubagentDepth: 1` -- challengers cannot spawn challengers
- `mode: 'blind'` isolation -- no prior phase artifacts (per context isolation modes entry below)

**ClarifyGPT consistency check (cheaper alternative to full council):**
Generate the implementation plan twice independently. If the two plans are inconsistent, ask a targeted clarification question (arxiv 2310.10996). Cheaper than a full multi-family council; useful as a pre-council filter for `'uncertain'` cases before spending on cross-family challengers.

**Program distribution divergence (Tier 2 behavioral signal where test oracles exist):**
SpecFix (2025): generate N independent implementations (N=5-10), compare behavioral divergence on tests. 43.58% of ambiguous function-specs detected, +30.9% Pass@1 on repaired specs. Hard prerequisite: requires a test oracle. Viable only for repos with good test coverage. Transfer to informal GitHub-style descriptions is the highest-priority unvalidated gap before treating as production-ready.

**Operator clarification UX:**

A useful clarification request is answerable in one decision, time-bounded, and shows what changes between interpretations:
```
Task: "Improve error handling in auth module"

Interpretation A: Add try/catch to the 3 unhandled failure points in token-service.ts (~50 lines, 1-2 hours)
Interpretation B: Redesign the error type hierarchy across the auth subsystem (~300 lines, needs separate shaping)

Evidence for A: ticket title says "improve" not "redesign"; linked issue reports a specific NPE in token-service.ts
Evidence for B: parent epic is "Auth module modernization"; prior PR comment mentioned "error types need a complete overhaul"

Reply: A / B / proceed with best judgment / abandon
[Default if no reply in 4 hours: A]
```

For overnight queues: batched clarification UX (approve/correct a queue, not N individual notifications) is more practical. Undesigned -- needs its own design pass.

**Feedback and calibration:**

Build the calibration data capture layer now. Log: checkpoint outcome, `confidenceBreakdown`, operator correction, downstream PR verdict, and review findings tagged as interpretation-related. Use behavior-based ground truth -- divergent implementations as the ambiguity label, not human majority-vote polls (majority-voted labels miscalibrate detectors by 55-87% ECE, 2026).

**`skipIntentResolution` escape hatch:**
Operator sets `skipIntentResolution: true` on a trigger, or agent self-declares skip for: very short ticket + very narrow affected area + `taskType: 'targeted_fix'` + no rival interpretations possible. Skipped sessions still require a one-line interpretation statement.

**Relationship to living work context:**
Tier 0 injection needs a dedicated system prompt section separate from `assembledContextSummary` to avoid the 8KB cap. The interpretation checkpoint artifact flows into `DiscoveryHandoffArtifactV1` and `PipelineRunContext` once living work context lands. Downstream phases should see what interpretation the discovery agent committed to.

**Research findings (resolved questions):**
- **Role prompts vs. model families**: Persona Collapse (2026) shows same-model role-separated agents converge. Cross-family required for genuine independence. Resolved: cross-family > role prompts.
- **Multi-agent debate confidence**: both agents escalate to ~83% confidence regardless of correctness. Never use stated confidence. Resolved: compare content only.
- **Rival interpretation generation**: open-ended enumeration produces anchored minor variations. Falsification forcing is more reliable. Resolved.
- **Vagueness vs. ambiguity**: empirically distinct failure modes requiring different responses. Resolved.
- **Production systems**: SWE-agent, AutoCodeRover, Agentless have no ambiguity detection phase. Confirmed by 4 independent 2025-2026 benchmarks. WorkTrain architecture is differentiated.
- **Calibration ground truth**: use divergent implementations, not human majority-vote labels. Resolved.

**Things still to hash out:**
- **Measure Subtype A vs B distribution first** -- retrospectively classify 10-20 past wrong-implementation cases before committing to the full design. If Subtype B dominates, the design needs explicit assumption-challenging and assumption-logging components that aren't here yet.
- Semantic entropy sampling cost at scale -- always on, or triggered only when structural signals fire first?
- Program distribution divergence (Tier 2) requires a test oracle. Fallback for repos without tests?
- Council model selection: which model families for challengers, how configured per workspace?
- Council cadence for large overnight queues: sampling approach may be more practical initially.
- `taskType` classification: separate pre-checkpoint step or first output of the same checkpoint?
- Batched clarification UX for overnight operators is undesigned.
- Minimal interim wiring for interpretation commitment through phases before living work context lands?

### Interpretation checkpoint for coding workflow: Candidate 5 (May 6, 2026)

**Status: done** | Shipped in PR #962 (feat/etienneb/interpretation-checkpoint, May 7, 2026)

**Score: 12** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Added `phase-0c-assumption-verification` step to `wr.coding-task` (v1.3.0 → v1.4.0) between Phase 0 (classify) and Phase 0.5 (upstream context). The step requires the coding agent to state a one-sentence interpretation before listing any assumptions, produce exactly 3 codebase assumptions with predicted locations and severity labels, verify each assumption by reading the predicted location, and output an `InterpretationArtifact` context key with `ambiguityLevel: clear | uncertain`. High-severity refutations surface to operator via `report_issue`. Also appended Subtype A/B classification prompt to the retrospective step for distribution measurement.

This is the first step of the intent gap intervention sequence: Candidate 5 (shipped) → Candidate 4 (git-grounded context, next) → Candidate 1 or 3 gated on Subtype A/B empirical data.

### External assumption ranking for interpretation checkpoint (May 6, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no (Candidate 5 shipped PR #962, May 7, 2026)

The interpretation checkpoint (Candidate 5) asks the coding agent to label each of its own assumptions as `severity: high` or `severity: low`. This self-labeling is a known weak point: an agent with a confident wrong prior may mislabel its most dangerous architectural assumption as low-severity to avoid triggering the gate. Self-assessed severity is the single lowest-confidence element in the pitch (confidence: 0.55).

An external agent -- one that did not produce the assumptions -- can independently rank them by actual risk before verification runs. The external agent receives only the ticket and the assumption list (not the producing agent's full context or reasoning) and answers: which of these assumptions is most load-bearing? Which, if wrong, would cause the most damage? Are there high-risk areas this agent didn't surface at all?

The producing agent then verifies in order of externally-ranked risk rather than self-assessed severity. Severity classification moves from self-labeling to an independent signal, removing the 0.55-confidence gap entirely.

**Relationship to targeted session review:** the external ranking agent's output is also a high-signal review moment -- if the external agent flags assumptions the producing agent didn't think to surface, that delta is direct evidence of an interpretation gap.

**Things to hash out:**
- What context does the ranking agent receive? Ticket + assumption list only, or also the affected file list and design lock references? More context improves ranking quality but risks contaminating the independence.
- Is this a lightweight parallel call (runs simultaneously with verification setup) or a blocking step?
- How are conflicts between self-assessed severity and external ranking resolved? External ranking should win, but the producing agent should see the disagreement and explain it.
- Cost: one additional inference call per session. Acceptable for standard/thorough sessions; probably skip for QUICK mode.

### Intent gap correction: fix the interpretation after assumption refutation (May 6, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no (Candidate 5 shipped PR #962, May 7, 2026)

When an agent's assumption-surfacing step (Candidate 5) refutes a high-severity assumption, the current scoped fix is to surface the refutation to the operator and halt. But the real problem is deeper: the wrong prior that caused the refuted assumption may have already contaminated earlier context -- the upstream context harvest, the problem framing, the `reframedProblem` and `challengedAssumptions` context keys. A simple "re-read the file and try again" doesn't fix a wrong model; it patches the symptom in one step while leaving the contaminated context intact. Long-term, a refuted assumption that reflects a codebase-specific wrong prior (Subtype B) should also update the Memory store and eventually the knowledge graph so future sessions don't repeat the mistake.

This is explicitly out of scope for the Candidate 5 pitch -- detection is the right first boundary. Correction is a separate, larger problem that depends on session context rollback, Memory store integration, and eventually the knowledge graph.

**Done looks like:** when a high-severity assumption is refuted mid-session, the system can: (1) identify which prior context keys were formed under the wrong prior, (2) trigger a targeted correction sub-flow that re-derives those keys with the corrected interpretation, (3) write the correction back to the Memory store so future sessions in this workspace start with the right prior.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the right granularity for context rollback? Rolling back individual keys vs. re-running entire prior phases are very different costs.
- How do you distinguish "assumption was wrong about this specific file" (local fix) from "assumption reflects a systematic wrong prior about this codebase pattern" (Memory store update warranted)?
- What is the trigger for a Memory store write -- every refuted high-severity assumption, or only ones confirmed as Subtype B by retrospective labeling?
- How does this interact with the knowledge graph when it ships? The assumption store (Candidate 2 from the intent gap discovery) and the knowledge graph are both candidates for receiving the correction signal.

**Relationship to existing entries:**
- Blocked by: Candidate 5 (assumption surfacing step) -- detection must exist before correction can be designed
- Related to: Subtype B intent failure (below), Knowledge graph (backlog), Memory store / living work context (shipped PR #939, #948, #952)

### Subtype B intent failure: agent has a wrong prior about what this codebase does (May 5, 2026)

**Status: idea -- needs empirical study before design** | Priority: high

**Score: 12** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:1 | Blocked: no

The intent resolution entry (above) addresses Subtype A failures -- tickets that are ambiguous or underspecified. This entry addresses Subtype B, which is categorically different and currently has no empirical intervention study in the literature.

**The failure mode:** The ticket is clear and specific. The agent reads it correctly. But the agent has a systematically wrong prior about what the described thing means in this codebase -- because its training data, or a superficially similar pattern it has seen, leads it to a confident interpretation that is locally coherent but wrong for this specific system.

Examples:
- "Add rate limiting to the auth service" -- agent implements token bucket at the HTTP layer because that's what rate limiting means in most codebases. This codebase does it at the middleware layer with a different interface. The ticket was clear; the agent's prior was wrong.
- "Fix the session expiry bug" -- agent finds and fixes the obvious TTL check. The actual expiry logic in this codebase is spread across three collaborating modules in a non-obvious way. The agent's mental model of "how session expiry works" doesn't match this codebase.
- "Update the delivery pipeline to handle X" -- agent knows what delivery pipelines look like. This codebase's delivery pipeline has specific invariants (atomic stage ordering, sidecar lifecycle) that violate the agent's general expectations. The update is technically correct in isolation but violates a codebase-specific invariant the agent didn't know existed.

**Why it's different from Subtype A:** You cannot fix this with more context harvest from Jira or Slack. The ticket is correctly specified. You cannot fix it with a council of agents -- challenger agents from different model families share the same wrong prior from training data. The problem is not ambiguity; it is that the agent's internal model of the codebase diverges from the actual codebase.

**Why it's hard to detect:** the agent's interpretation feels correct and internally consistent. It will self-report high confidence. The semantic entropy signal may be low (all samples converge on the same wrong interpretation). A challenger agent may produce the same wrong interpretation independently. The failure is invisible until review or testing.

**What might actually work (inferred, not empirically validated):**

*Explicit assumption surfacing before acting:* Before touching any code, require the agent to write down: "Here is how I believe this component works based on what I have read." Then verify those beliefs against the codebase. If the agent's stated model of "how the delivery pipeline works" conflicts with what the code actually does, that conflict is the signal. This is different from rival interpretations (Subtype A) -- it is rival models of the existing system.

*Assumption-challenging agent:* A separate lightweight agent reads the primary agent's stated assumptions about the codebase and actively searches for contradicting evidence. Not "is the ticket ambiguous" but "is the agent's model of this codebase correct?" Spawned with `mode: 'blind'` (no prior context) so it approaches the codebase fresh, then compares its reading to the primary agent's stated model.

*Prior-invalidation pass in discovery:* Discovery workflow includes a mandatory step: for each major architectural assumption the agent is making, find one piece of codebase evidence that would invalidate it. If the agent assumes "rate limiting is at the HTTP layer," it must search for evidence that this is wrong before proceeding. Forces falsification of the prior rather than confirmation.

*Historical session notes as prior correction:* If prior sessions have established "in this codebase, X works differently than you'd expect because Y," that context must be injected before the agent forms its model. This is the living work context applied across pipeline runs, not just within one run -- a per-workspace knowledge store of "things that are surprising about this codebase." Related to the knowledge graph backlog item.

**Why Confidence is 1 (needs discovery before design can begin):**

There is no empirical study of interventions for Subtype B in ticket-driven coding agents. AskBench's AskOverconfidence condition (arxiv 2602.11199) confirms agents fail differently on false-premise queries -- but "false premise" in a benchmark is a planted incorrect assumption, not a wrong prior from training data. The mechanisms may be similar but the intervention pathway is different. This needs:
1. Empirical measurement of how often Subtype B vs Subtype A causes WorkTrain failures (the NS2 step from the independent research brief)
2. A controlled study of whether assumption-surfacing before acting actually reduces Subtype B failures
3. Design of the assumption-challenging agent -- what exactly it reads, what it produces, how the coordinator uses it

**Relationship to other entries:**
- "Intent resolution" (above): addresses Subtype A. This entry is the Subtype B complement.
- "Living work context": the per-workspace knowledge store of codebase surprises is partial infrastructure for fixing Subtype B across sessions.
- "Knowledge graph" (backlog): structural understanding of the codebase that would give the agent a ground-truth model to compare its priors against.
- "Context isolation modes": the assumption-challenging agent needs `mode: 'blind'` to approach the codebase without anchoring on the primary agent's stated assumptions.

**Things to hash out:**
- How do you distinguish "the agent has a wrong prior" from "the ticket is genuinely ambiguous about which part of the system to change"? The boundary is fuzzy -- a ticket that doesn't name the specific module is Subtype A; a ticket that names the module but the agent's model of that module is wrong is Subtype B.
- What format should "stated assumptions" take? Free-prose is hard to verify. A structured list of `{ assumption: string, evidence: string, falsificationQuery: string }` is verifiable but requires the agent to produce it honestly.
- The assumption-challenging agent needs to approach the codebase independently. But it also needs to know what assumptions to challenge -- which means it needs the primary agent's stated assumption list. Is that contamination? No -- it is exactly the right input. The isolation is from the primary agent's conclusions, not its stated premises.
- How does this interact with the `skipIntentResolution` escape hatch? Subtype B failures can occur even on tickets that pass quality pre-screening and look unambiguous. The skip hatch should not bypass assumption surfacing for `'refactor'` or `'architectural'` tasks.
- Is the right long-term fix a knowledge graph (structural ground truth the agent can compare its model against) rather than per-session assumption surfacing? Knowledge graph is higher-confidence but much higher cost to build. Assumption surfacing is lower cost but relies on the agent honestly reporting its own priors.

### Scope rationalization: agent silently accepts collateral damage (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

When an agent makes a change that breaks or degrades something outside its immediate task scope, it often recognizes the impact but rationalizes it as acceptable because "that's not in scope for this task." The reasoning feels locally valid -- the agent was asked to do X, X is done correctly, the side effect on Y is noted but deprioritized. This produces a PR that is correct for X and silently broken for Y.

This is exactly what happened with the commit SHA change: setting `agentCommitShas` to always empty correctly fixes the faked SHA bug, but degrades the console's SHA display for all sessions going forward. A scoped agent might note "this makes the console show empty SHAs" and proceed anyway because fixing the console display is "a separate ticket."

**Why this is insidious:** the agent's reasoning is locally coherent. It did not make a mistake within its scope. The problem is that autonomous agents operating in isolation cannot always see when a locally correct change has unacceptable global consequences -- and even when they can see it, they lack a good mechanism to stop, escalate, and surface the impact rather than proceeding.

**Known manifestations:**
- Agent correctly fixes a bug but the fix changes a public API contract, breaking callers it didn't check
- Agent refactors a module for clarity but silently changes behavior in an edge case it considered minor
- Agent adds a feature but disables or degrades an existing feature as a side effect, judging the tradeoff acceptable on its own
- Agent's change passes all tests but the tests don't cover the degraded behavior
- Agent notes a downstream impact in session notes but does not block, escalate, or file a follow-up ticket
- **Agent reframes a bug as "a key tradeoff to document."** This is a specific and common failure: the agent detects a real problem it caused, correctly identifies that it's a problem, and instead of filing it as a bug or escalating, reclassifies it as an "accepted design decision" or "known limitation" in documentation. The bug is real. Documenting it is not fixing it. This pattern actively buries bugs.

**Done looks like:** when an agent makes a change that degrades something outside its scope, it surfaces the degradation explicitly before the PR merges -- either by blocking (filing a follow-up issue as a condition of the current PR merging) or escalating to the coordinator for a decision. A PR that silently buries a regression in a comment or documentation should not pass review.

**Things to hash out:**
- How does an agent distinguish "acceptable tradeoff within scope" from "collateral damage that must be escalated"? The line is fuzzy and context-dependent. A hard rule ("never degrade existing behavior") is too strict for refactors; a soft heuristic ("if it affects other code, escalate") is too broad.
- Should the agent be required to enumerate side effects as part of the verification phase, and should the coordinator review that list before merging? This is the proof record concept applied to impact assessment rather than just correctness.
- What is the right mechanism for the agent to pause and escalate? Currently `report_issue` is for task obstacles; `signal_coordinator` is for coordinator events. There is no structured "I need a decision on whether this tradeoff is acceptable" signal.
- Test coverage is the obvious mitigation -- if Y has tests, the agent's change would fail them. But not everything has tests, and agents can rationalize skipping test runs for "unrelated" paths.
- Is there a way to detect likely collateral damage statically before the agent acts? A pre-commit check that measures what changed beyond the declared `filesChanged` list, for example, could surface unexpected side effects automatically.
- The knowledge graph and architectural invariant rules (pattern and architecture validation) are partial solutions -- they can flag when a change violates a declared constraint. But they only work for constraints that have been explicitly codified.

### Living work context: shared knowledge document that accumulates across the full pipeline (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: done** | Core infra shipped May 5, 2026 (PR #939). All three gaps fixed (PRs #948, #952). Residual: `github_prs_poll` direct dispatch path deferred to Phase 2 (MemoryStore).

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Shipped (PR #939):** `ShapingHandoffArtifactV1` + `CodingHandoffArtifactV1` + enriched `DiscoveryHandoffArtifactV1`, `PhaseHandoffArtifact` union, `buildContextSummary()` pure function with per-phase selection, `PipelineRunContext` per-run JSON with `PhaseResult<T>`, crash recovery via `active-run.json` pointer, phase quality gates (fallback escalates, partial warns), persistence failure escalation, 4 workflow authoring changes, adversarial behavioral test (AC 21), `contractRef` validation test.

**Gap #1 -- fixed (PR #948):** Contract test added: `tests/unit/context-chain-contract.test.ts` pins the seam between `buildContextSummary()` coordinator output and `buildSessionContext()` daemon input across all 4 phase transitions.

**Gap #2 -- fixed (PRs #952, #954):** The actual gap was narrower than originally described: QUICK_REVIEW/REVIEW_ONLY do invoke `runPrReviewCoordinator` with a `contextAssembler` wired. The real issue was the **fix agent spawn** in `runFixAgentLoop()` was not forwarding `reviewSpawnContext` -- fixed with one line. Also shipped: `CoordinatorSpawnContext` typed interface in `src/coordinators/types.ts` with explicit fields and no index signature, replacing `Readonly<Record<string,unknown>>` across all coordinator spawn sites (5 files). Passing unknown keys is now a compile error. Residual: the `github_prs_poll` direct dispatch path bypasses the coordinator entirely; fix agents from that path still start cold. Deferred to Phase 2 (MemoryStore pre-assembly).

**Gap #3 -- fixed (PR #948):** Console session detail view now surfaces an **Injected Context** card when `assembledContextSummary` is present in the session's `context_set` event.

When a multi-agent pipeline runs -- discovery → shaping → coding → review → fix → re-review -- no agent has a complete picture of what came before it. The coding agent has the goal. The review agent has the code. The fix agent has the findings. None of them have the accumulated context from the full pipeline: why this approach was chosen over alternatives, what was ruled out, what constraints were discovered, what architectural decisions were made, what edge cases were handled, what the review found and why.

Each agent reconstructs intent from incomplete context, which is why review finds things coding missed (review doesn't know what the coding agent was trying to do), why fix sessions address symptoms without understanding causes (no access to the architectural reasoning), and why agents repeat work that earlier agents already did.

**The real need:** a **living work context document** that every agent in the pipeline both reads from and contributes to:

- **Discovery adds**: why this approach over alternatives, what was ruled out, constraints found
- **Shaping adds**: the bounded problem, no-gos, acceptance criteria -- the verifiable contract
- **Architecture/coding adds**: why specific decisions were made, what invariants must hold, what was deliberately deferred and why
- **Review adds**: what was found, the underlying reason it was missed, what the fix must address
- **Fix adds**: what was changed and why the fix is correct per the spec

The spec from shaping is one layer of this -- the *what to build* contract. But the full context also includes the *why* from discovery, the *how* decisions from coding, and the *what was missed* from review. All of it should be accessible to every downstream agent.

This is related to the "session knowledge log" backlog entry (agents appending to `session-knowledge.jsonl`) but is explicitly a **multi-agent shared artifact**, not a single session's private log. The coordinator is responsible for maintaining and passing this document to each spawned agent.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the right format? A growing markdown document is human-readable but hard to query. Structured JSON is queryable but loses the narrative. A hybrid (structured frontmatter + narrative body) may be best.
- Where does it live? In the worktree (accessible to the coding agent)? In a well-known workspace path? In the session store (accessible to all agents via `read_artifact`)?
- Who owns writing to it -- the coordinator (scripts that have no LLM)? Each agent? Both?
- When a pure coordinator pipeline has no main agent, who synthesizes the discovery findings into the document? The discovery agent writes its own section; the coordinator passes it through. But synthesis across sections (connecting discovery constraints to coding decisions) requires reasoning.
- How does the review agent know which work context applies to the current PR? It needs discovery without being told explicitly.
- What's the minimum viable version -- is just passing the shaped spec (`SPEC.md`) to the coding and review agents already a major improvement, even without the full living document?
- This is distinct from "context injection at dispatch time" (passing a static bundle) -- the living document evolves as the pipeline progresses. Does the coordinator update it after each phase completes?
- **Is "document" even the right abstraction?** A flat document implies agents read it linearly. But agents need to query it selectively -- the coding agent needs "what constraints affect this decision?", the review agent needs "what did the coding agent say about this module?". A structured knowledge store (typed facts, queryable by agent role and topic) may be more useful than a document. This connects to the knowledge graph backlog entry -- the work-unit knowledge store may be a per-pipeline instance of the same infrastructure. This is worth hashing out before designing the format.

### Move backlog to a dedicated worktrain-meta repo (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 11** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The backlog (`docs/ideas/backlog.md`) lives in the code repo, which means every feature branch has its own version of it. Ideas added mid-session on a feature branch are held hostage until that PR merges. If two branches both modify the backlog, git merge conflicts occur. There is no single authoritative place to add an idea that immediately applies everywhere.

**Proposed fix:** move the backlog to a dedicated `worktrain-meta` repo (e.g. `~/git/personal/worktrain-meta/`). This is a separate git repo that is never branched for feature work -- you commit and push directly to main whenever an idea is added. Full git history is preserved. No code branch ever touches it. WorkTrain daemon sessions and the `npm run backlog` script are configured with the path to this repo.

**Why separate repo over a dedicated branch in this repo:**
- A dedicated branch in this repo can be accidentally contaminated by a rebase or merge
- CI runs on every push to a branch here -- wasting resources on docs-only changes
- The backlog lifecycle (ideas, grooming, scoring) is independent of the code release cycle -- they should be independent repos
- When native backlog operations (structured data, SQLite) are built later, the backlog is already isolated and the migration doesn't touch the code repo

**Migration steps:**
1. Create `~/git/personal/worktrain-meta/` git repo, push to GitHub as a new repo
2. Move `docs/ideas/backlog.md` there as the initial commit
3. Update `scripts/backlog-priority.ts` path
4. Update AGENTS.md reference to `npm run backlog`
5. Update daemon-soul.md and any session context that references the backlog path
6. Add `backlogRepoPath` to `~/.workrail/config.json` so the daemon knows where to find it

**Things to hash out:**
- Should the worktrain-meta repo also hold other cross-cutting artifacts like planning docs, the now-next-later roadmap, open-work-inventory? Or just the backlog?
- How do subagents spawned in a worktree find the backlog? They need the path configured, not relative to the code workspace.
- When native structured backlog operations are built, does the storage backend (SQLite) live in worktrain-meta or in `~/.workrail/data/`? The history requirement points toward worktrain-meta (git-tracked), but query performance points toward `~/.workrail/data/` (local database).

### Subagent context package: project vision and task goal baked into spawning (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 12** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

When WorkTrain spawns a subagent today, the operator (or the main agent) must manually write out all context: what the project is, what WorkTrain's vision is, what the task is trying to accomplish, what documents exist, what the end goal is. Subagents know nothing -- no conversation history, no project familiarity, no awareness of the vision. If the context briefing is thin or missing, the subagent works in the dark and produces generic output.

Two things need to be baked into the spawning infrastructure:

1. **Project-level context package**: every spawned subagent automatically receives a synthesized briefing about the WorkTrain project -- what it is, what it is trying to become, the architectural layers (daemon vs MCP server vs console), the coding philosophy, and pointers to key docs (AGENTS.md, backlog.md, relevant design docs). This should not require the spawning agent to manually write it out each time.

2. **Task-level context package**: every spawned subagent automatically receives the vision and end goal of the specific task -- not just the technical instructions, but WHY the task matters, what it enables, and how it fits into the larger picture. A subagent that understands the goal can adapt when it hits unexpected situations; one that only has instructions cannot.

This is related to the "Coordinator context injection standard" and "Context budget per spawned agent" backlog entries, but is broader -- it applies to all subagent spawning, not just coordinator-spawned child sessions.

**Critical design constraint:** WorkTrain may not always have a "main" agent assembling context dynamically. A pure coordinator pipeline is deterministic TypeScript code -- it knows the goal it was given and the results it gets back, but has no ambient understanding of the project vision and cannot synthesize what context a subagent needs at runtime. This means context packages cannot be assembled dynamically by the spawning agent; they must be **pre-built and attached as structured data**, assembled by the daemon from configured sources before the session starts. This is closer to the trigger-derived knowledge configuration idea than to runtime context assembly.

**Things to hash out:**
- Where does the project-level context package live and how is it kept current? A static template in `~/.workrail/daemon-soul.md` covers behavioral rules but not project vision -- these are different concerns.
- In a pure coordinator pipeline (no main agent), who decides what goes in the context package for each session type? Must be declared configuration, not runtime synthesis.
- Should context profiles be declared per workflow, per trigger type, or per session role (coding vs review vs discovery)?
- What is the right size for an auto-injected context package? Too small loses signal; too large crowds out the actual task prompt.
- Should the package be structured (JSON/YAML) for programmatic injection, or prose for human readability?
- How does this interact with the existing workspace context injection (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, daemon-soul.md)?
- Whether a "main" orchestrating agent is needed at all, or whether pure coordinator scripts plus well-configured context packages are sufficient -- this is an open question that requires real pipeline testing to answer.

### Subagent context isolation modes: enforced context sharing and contamination prevention (May 5, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 12** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

When WorkTrain spawns a subagent, the spawning agent decides what context to pass. Today this is purely by convention -- there is no mechanism to enforce isolation or guarantee completeness. Two distinct failure modes require opposite fixes:

**Contamination (too much context):** A challenger agent spawned to independently evaluate an interpretation receives the primary agent's interpretation in the context bundle. It anchors on it and produces a biased reading. A review agent receives the coding agent's self-assessment and validates it rather than challenging it. These are cases where context leakage actively undermines the agent's purpose -- independence destroyed by prior context.

**Starvation (too little context):** A coding agent spawned without discovery findings re-investigates settled questions. A review agent without shaping constraints cannot check whether the implementation satisfies them. Context absence causes wasted work or wrong output.

Today both are addressed by convention. Convention fails silently -- the spawning agent follows its own judgment, which may be wrong. Even the orchestrating agent can contaminate a challenger without realizing it (as happened when spawning the research agents in this session without realizing context was being leaked).

**The right fix is structural enforcement, not rules.** Context isolation mode should be a declared property of the spawn call, enforced by coordinator infrastructure, not managed by following instructions.

**Proposed isolation modes:**

```typescript
type ContextIsolationMode =
  | { mode: 'full' }
  // Agent receives complete accumulated context: Tier 0 project identity +
  // prior phase artifacts + task context. Default for most pipeline phases.

  | { mode: 'task-only' }
  // Agent receives only task description + Tier 0 project identity.
  // No prior phase artifacts, no intermediate results.
  // For agents that should approach the task fresh but know the project.

  | { mode: 'blind' }
  // Agent receives only the raw inputs declared at spawn time.
  // No Tier 0 injection, no prior artifacts, no accumulated context.
  // For adversarial/challenger agents where independence is the whole point.
  // The spawning call must explicitly declare what inputs to pass.

  | { mode: 'custom'; include: ContextKey[]; exclude: ContextKey[] }
  // Explicit allowlist/blocklist. For partial context cases
  // (e.g. review agent gets shaping constraints but not coding agent's self-assessment).
```

`mode: 'blind'` should be the enforced default for any session with `role: 'challenger' | 'adversarial' | 'evaluator'`. The coordinator cannot accidentally contaminate a challenger when the session declaration forbids it.

**Note on 'blind' mode:** true blindness (no Tier 0 either) may be too aggressive. A challenger without the project's coding philosophy or architectural principles is missing the most important constraints. "No prior phase artifacts" is probably the right isolation boundary, not "no context whatsoever." A `challenger` mode that strips prior results but keeps Tier 0 may be more useful. Open question.

**Enforcement point:** `spawnSession` in the coordinator infrastructure (`createCoordinatorDeps`). The spawning call declares the mode; the infrastructure assembles the context bundle according to the declared mode; the spawning agent cannot override it by passing extra fields. Validate at boundaries, trust inside.

**Observability:** when an evaluation was produced by a `blind` or `task-only` session, that fact should be recorded in the session store so the independence of the evaluation is auditable. Without this, the isolation guarantee is invisible.

**Relationship to existing entries:**
- "Subagent context package" (above) is about ensuring agents receive enough context -- the `full` and `task-only` modes are the enforcement side of that design.
- "Council of agents" in the intent resolution entry assumes `blind` mode for challengers -- this entry is what makes that assumption enforceable.
- `buildContextSummary(priorArtifacts, targetPhase)` in living work context is the selection logic for `custom` mode.

**Things to hash out:**
- Should `mode` be declared on the workflow definition, the trigger, or the `spawnSession` call? Workflow definition is the right answer (the workflow knows its role), but requires a new schema field.
- How does declared mode interact with the agent's tool access? A `blind` challenger can still read workspace files. True isolation may require tool path restrictions alongside context restrictions.
- Custom `include`/`exclude` lists create maintenance burden as context keys evolve. Is there a better abstraction -- e.g. declaring the agent's role and having infrastructure derive the right context set from a role-to-context mapping?
- Should `task-only` include or exclude Tier 0 project identity? Including it is almost always better, but the operator may have reasons to exclude it.

### Agent-assisted backlog and issue enrichment (Apr 28, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 7** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

When a new idea or task is captured -- in the backlog, as a GitHub issue, or during a session -- there is often a gap between "the thing was written down" and "the thing is ready to be designed." The open questions, the interaction effects, the scope boundaries, and the failure modes are not thought through yet. A human has to do that work manually before the idea can be groomed.

WorkTrain could assist with this: after an idea is captured, an agent reads it and identifies what still needs to be hashed out before the idea is ready for design. Not proposing solutions -- surfacing the questions that need answers.

**Things to hash out:**
- What triggers this enrichment? On every new issue? Only on request? Only when an issue is labeled a certain way?
- How does this interact with the human's own thinking process -- does an agent-generated question list help, or does it anchor thinking prematurely?
- Should the agent's questions appear in the GitHub issue as a comment, be written back to the backlog entry, or live somewhere else entirely?
- Who is responsible for answering the questions -- the human, another agent, or some combination?
- Is this valuable enough to run on every idea, or does it dilute the signal when applied broadly?
- How do you prevent the agent from generating obvious or generic questions that add no real value?

### Agent-assisted backlog prioritization (Apr 28, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 7** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Some projects have a clear ticket queue with explicit priority set by a human. Others -- like workrail itself -- have an unordered backlog where the agent needs to decide what to work on next based on impact, effort, and dependencies. Without a structured way to reason about priority, agents either pick arbitrarily or ask the human every time.

WorkTrain should be able to apply a scoring rubric to backlog items and surface a prioritized working order. The rubric scores each item on dimensions like impact, effort, leverage over other items, and how well understood the problem is. Items that score high and have no blockers rise to the top. The agent doesn't decide what to work on -- it produces a ranked list for the human to accept or override.

**Tentative rubric (to be validated):**

Five dimensions, each scored 1-3. Score = sum (max 15). Items marked **Blocked** are pushed below all unblocked items regardless of score.

| Dimension | 3 | 2 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Correctness** | Silent wrong output, crash, or skipped safety gate | Degraded behavior, misleading output, test coverage gap | No effect on correctness |
| **Capability** | Meaningfully expands what WorkTrain can do or who can use it | Reduces friction for an *active* use case today | Polish, internal quality, or nothing anyone is actively blocked by right now |
| **Effort** (inverted) | Hours to a day or two | A few days to a week | Weeks or longer, significant design work needed first |
| **Leverage** | Prerequisite for multiple other items | Enables one or two downstream items | Standalone, nothing depends on it |
| **Confidence** | Clear problem, clear direction, just needs implementation | Problem is clear, but has open questions to hash out first | Still needs discovery or design before work can begin |

**Blocked flag:** annotate with *what* the item is blocked by, not just yes/no -- "Blocked: needs knowledge graph" vs "Blocked: needs dispatchCondition" carry very different timelines. Blocked items are listed separately regardless of score.

**Scoring multi-phase items:** score the first actionable phase, not the full vision. An item whose Phase 1 is two days of work should not score Effort 1 just because Phase 3 is months away.

**Tiebreaker for items at the same score:** prefer the item that makes the next item easier to execute, even if it is not a formal prerequisite. A high-score easy item that reduces friction for several downstream items is more valuable than its score alone shows.

**Things to hash out:**
- Should the rubric be defined once globally, or per-workspace/per-project? Different projects have different definitions of "impact."
- How does the agent know enough about the project context to score impact accurately? Without domain knowledge, scores will be generic.
- Who owns the scores -- are they written back to the backlog entries, stored separately, or only computed on demand?
- How do you prevent the scoring from becoming a mechanical exercise that produces a ranked list nobody looks at?
- Should the agent re-score as items are completed and the landscape changes, or is one-time scoring sufficient?
- How does this interact with explicit human priority signals -- if the human labels something high-priority, does the agent's score override or defer?

### `wr.refactoring` workflow (Apr 28, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

A dedicated `wr.refactoring` workflow for structural refactors that don't change behavior. Distinct from `wr.coding-task` because refactors have a different shape: no new features, no bug fixes, just architecture alignment. The workflow should enforce:
- **Discovery phase**: understand current state, identify violations, classify scope
- **Test-first phase**: write tests for any extracted pure functions BEFORE extracting them (TDD red)
- **Extraction phase**: one slice at a time, tests green after each
- **Verification phase**: full suite green, build clean, no behavior changes
- **Doc update phase**: update any reference docs that describe the changed invariants

The `wr.coding-task` workflow has too much overhead for pure refactors (design review, risk assessment gating, PR strategy) and not enough refactor-specific discipline (test-first enforcement, behavior-unchanged verification).

**Things to hash out:**
- What distinguishes a refactor from a behavior-changing fix? Where is the boundary when a refactor reveals a latent bug and fixing it is the right call?
- How does the workflow verify "no behavior change" for code without tests? Does absence of test failures actually prove behavioral equivalence, or is a separate assertion required?
- Should the workflow gate on having tests before extraction begins, or treat test-writing as a step within it?
- Who is the target user -- a human author running it interactively, or an autonomous daemon session? The constraints differ significantly (daemon can't ask clarifying questions mid-run).
- How does this interact with the existing `wr.coding-task` Small fast-path? Should refactors always bypass that path?
- What happens when a refactor spans multiple modules that are each independently shippable? Does the workflow support incremental delivery, or is it a single atomic PR?

### API key baked into launchd plist at install time (Apr 24, 2026)

`CAPTURED_ENV_VARS` in `src/cli/commands/worktrain-daemon.ts` contains only non-secret vars (`AWS_PROFILE`, `PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, feature flags). No `*_API_KEY` or token vars are captured into the plist. Secrets go in `~/.workrail/.env`, which is loaded by `loadDaemonEnv()` at daemon startup.

### WorkTrain identity model: act as the user, not as a bot (Apr 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 7** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Design decision:** WorkTrain acts as the configured user, not as a separate bot account.

**Why bot accounts are the wrong default:** Most developers -- especially at companies -- cannot create separate bot GitHub accounts. Jira, GitLab, and other enterprise systems tie authentication to employee identity. Requiring a separate account creates friction that blocks adoption entirely.

WorkTrain's attribution signal is the **work pattern**, not the identity:
- Branch name: `worktrain/<sessionId>` -- immediately recognizable
- PR body footer: "Automated by WorkTrain" + session ID + workflow name
- Commit co-author: `Co-Authored-By: WorkTrain <worktrain@noreply>`

Anyone reviewing a PR knows it was autonomous. The developer's name on the PR is not a lie -- they configured WorkTrain to do this work on their behalf.

**Queue membership without a bot account:** Label-based opt-in works with any setup:
- Apply `worktrain:ready` label to an issue → WorkTrain picks it up
- The queue poll trigger uses `queueType: label` + `queueLabel: "worktrain:ready"`
- No bot account, no special permissions, no friction

`workOnAll: true` (future) processes any open issue -- also requires no bot account.

**Token:** `$GITHUB_TOKEN` (your personal token) or a fine-grained PAT scoped to the target repo. WorkTrain uses it for API calls; the commit identity (`git user.name`, `git user.email`) is set separately in the worktree and can be whatever you want.

**Attribution / signing:**
1. Commits made by WorkTrain include `Co-Authored-By: WorkTrain <worktrain@etienneb.dev>`. The configured `worktrain-bot` identity is consistent across all workspaces.
2. PR/MR description footer: session link, workflow names run. Clearly WorkTrain-authored.
3. Issue/comment attribution: WorkTrain comments include "WorkTrain investigation" with session link.

`actAsUser: true` explicit opt-in, only for commits/PRs (never emails or Slack without additional permission), PR description always notes "Created by WorkTrain," full audit log in `~/.workrail/actions-as-user.jsonl`.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the opt-in surface for `actAsUser: true`? Is it a per-trigger config flag, a workspace config, or a one-time global consent?
- If a user's employer audits their git history and finds autonomous commits attributed to the user, what is the disclosure expectation? Should WorkTrain disclose this more prominently in onboarding?
- How does the identity model interact with GPG commit signing? A personal signing key cannot be given to the daemon without significant key management risk.
- What is the right behavior when the configured user identity is unavailable (expired token, revoked PAT)? Should WorkTrain fail fast or fall back to a bot identity?
- How should the `actions-as-user.jsonl` audit log be surfaced and retained? Is the user responsible for it, or should WorkTrain manage rotation and visibility?
- Does `actAsUser` ever apply to things beyond commits/PRs -- issue comments, status updates, webhook calls? Where is the ceiling?

### Kill switch and commit signing (Apr 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:3 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Kill switch:** `worktrain kill-sessions` -- aborts all running daemon sessions immediately. Useful when WorkTrain is doing something unexpected. Sends abort signal to all active sessions, marks them user-killed in the event log.

**Commit signing:** verify `git commit` honors existing `commit.gpgsign` config, or add explicit opt-out for bot identities that don't have signing keys. Empirically verify before declaring this solved.

**Things to hash out:**
- Should `worktrain kill-sessions` kill all sessions globally, per-workspace, or per-trigger? What granularity does an operator actually need?
- What happens to in-flight worktrees and uncommitted changes when a session is kill-switched? Is the operator responsible for cleanup, or should the kill switch attempt it?
- How is the kill switch surfaced -- CLI only, or also a console button? What is the latency between kill command and actual session termination?
- For commit signing: if `commit.gpgsign = true` in the user's gitconfig and the daemon has no signing key, does every commit silently fail? What is the right fallback behavior?
- Should WorkTrain detect a signing configuration mismatch at `daemon --start` time rather than discovering it mid-session?
- Is per-bot-identity gpg key management in scope, or is the answer always "disable signing for WorkTrain identities"?

### triggers.yml hot-reload (Apr 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The daemon reads `triggers.yml` once at startup. Any change requires a full daemon restart. This creates friction during trigger configuration iteration.

**The fix:** watch `triggers.yml` for changes using `fs.watch()` or `chokidar`, re-validate on change, and if valid swap the in-memory trigger index without restarting the daemon. Active sessions in flight are unaffected (they hold their own trigger snapshot). New sessions after the reload use the new config.

**Partial hot-reload is acceptable:** if the new `triggers.yml` fails validation, log a warning and keep the old config. Don't crash the daemon on a syntax error.

**Implementation:** `TriggerRouter` already accepts a `TriggerIndex` at construction. The hot-reload path re-calls `loadTriggerStore()` and swaps the index reference on the router. `PollingScheduler` loops are keyed per trigger -- swapping the index would also require restarting the polling loops cleanly.

**Things to hash out:**
- When a trigger is removed from `triggers.yml` on a hot-reload, what happens to its in-flight sessions? Should they run to completion, be aborted, or be suspended?
- When a trigger is modified (e.g. `maxSessionMinutes` changed), should in-flight sessions using the old config complete under the old limits or pick up the new ones?
- How should validation errors in the new `triggers.yml` be surfaced to the operator? A log line is easy to miss -- is there a better notification path?
- Does hot-reload need to be transactional (all-or-nothing swap) or can partial updates be safe?
- Should file watching be optional (behind a `--watch` flag) to avoid surprising behavior for users who prefer explicit restarts?

### External task tracker integrations: Jira, Linear, Notion, and beyond (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 11** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain currently picks up work from GitHub and GitLab. Most engineering teams track work in Jira, Linear, Notion, or similar systems -- not in GitHub issues. Without native trigger adapters for these systems, WorkTrain cannot be used as the default development workflow for teams that don't use GitHub Issues as their primary tracker.

The vision says WorkTrain picks up tasks "from external systems (GitHub issues, GitLab MRs, Jira tickets, webhooks)." The webhook trigger (`provider: generic`) handles anything with a POST endpoint, but it requires the operator to wire up field extraction manually and provides no assignee filtering, label filtering, or status-transition detection out of the box. A first-class adapter for each tracker would handle the integration details and give operators a clean configuration surface.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the right abstraction boundary? A generic polling adapter with per-tracker field mapping (same pattern as `github_issues_poll` / `gitlab_poll`) vs. a more opinionated per-tracker adapter that understands Jira workflow states, Linear priorities, etc.
- Jira's API requires OAuth or API token; Linear uses API keys; Notion uses integration tokens. Is secret resolution via `$ENV_VAR_NAME` sufficient, or is a richer credentials model needed?
- For Jira specifically: issue assignment events are not available via webhook without Jira admin access to configure webhooks. Does WorkTrain need a polling adapter (`jira_poll`) as the primary path, with webhook as an optional enhancement?
- What context does each tracker inject into the workflow session? Jira issues have epics, acceptance criteria, sprint context, labels. Linear issues have priority, team, estimate, project. The context mapping needs to capture what's useful without overwhelming the session.
- How does deduplication work across tracker adapters? A Jira issue that was already picked up and is in-flight should not be dispatched again on the next poll cycle, even if it was updated.

### GitHub webhook trigger with assignee/event filtering (Apr 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium-high

**Score: 11** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The `github_queue_poll` trigger has a 5-minute latency floor. Assigning an issue fires a GitHub webhook immediately -- WorkTrain should start within seconds, not minutes.

**What exists today:** `provider: generic` handles arbitrary POST webhooks with HMAC validation and `goalTemplate: "{{$.issue.title}}"` extracts issue title from payload. You can use this today but without an assignee filter -- any issue event fires the trigger regardless of who it's assigned to.

**What's missing:** a `dispatchCondition` field that gates dispatch on a payload value:

```yaml
- id: self-improvement-hook
  provider: generic
  workflowId: coding-task-workflow-agentic
  goalTemplate: "{{$.issue.title}}"
  hmacSecret: $GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  dispatchCondition:
    payloadPath: "$.assignee.login"
    equals: "worktrain-etienneb"
```

**The hook+poll pattern (recommended for production):**
```yaml
# Primary: instant response via webhook
- id: self-improvement-hook
  provider: generic
  goalTemplate: "{{$.issue.title}}"
  hmacSecret: $GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  dispatchCondition:
    payloadPath: "$.assignee.login"
    equals: "worktrain-etienneb"

# Fallback: catch anything missed during downtime
- id: self-improvement-poll
  provider: github_queue_poll
  pollIntervalSeconds: 3600
```

**Implementation:** Add `dispatchCondition: { payloadPath, equals }` to `TriggerDefinition` -- parsed in `trigger-store.ts`, checked in `trigger-router.ts` before enqueuing. Single condition is MVP; AND/OR logic is follow-up.

**Things to hash out:**
- The hook+poll pattern requires two separate trigger IDs for the same workflow. How does deduplication work when both fire near-simultaneously (hook fires, poll also picks up the same item before the hook session completes)?
- `dispatchCondition` only checks a static `equals` comparison. What is the right expansion path for more complex conditions (event type filtering, multiple assignees, label presence)?
- GitHub webhooks require a public endpoint to receive events. How does this work for users without a public IP (laptop behind NAT, VPN)? Is a tunneling strategy (Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok) in scope or out of scope for this feature?
- Should the `hmacSecret` validation happen before or after `dispatchCondition` evaluation? Order affects error handling for malformed requests.

### Gate 2 follow-up: per-trigger gh CLI token for delivery (Apr 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:3 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

`delivery-action.ts` calls `gh pr create` using whatever `gh` CLI auth is configured globally -- it does not pass a per-trigger token. For single-identity setups this is fine. For multi-identity setups (Zillow service account alongside personal trigger), the globally authenticated `gh` user handles all PR creation, silently using the wrong identity.

**Fix when multi-identity is needed:** Pass `GH_TOKEN=<triggerToken>` env override to `execFn` when calling `gh pr create` and `gh pr merge`. Not a blocker for single-identity. Prerequisite for multi-identity support.

**Things to hash out:**
- How many distinct identities is the multi-identity design actually expected to serve? Is the target use case one personal + one work account, or arbitrary N?
- Where does the per-trigger token come from at runtime -- the trigger definition in `triggers.yml`, a secrets store, or an environment variable resolved at dispatch time?
- If a trigger's token is rotated mid-run, does the in-flight session pick up the new token or fail on the old one?
- Is this blocked by anything upstream -- does the `gh` CLI fully support per-call `GH_TOKEN` overrides without side effects on global auth state?

### Queue opt-in design: unresolved decisions (Apr 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium -- DO NOT IMPLEMENT until these questions are answered

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:3 Lev:1 Con:1 | Blocked: no

The self-improvement queue was partially implemented using label-based opt-in, then later walked back. This section records what's actually unresolved.

**The configurable queue shape (already designed, partially implemented):**
```
{ "queue": { "type": "github_assignee", "user":  "worktrain-etienneb" } }
{ "queue": { "type": "github_label",    "name":  "worktrain:ready" } }
{ "queue": { "type": "github_query",    "search": "is:issue is:open ..." } }
{ "queue": { "type": "jql",             "query": "assignee=currentUser() AND status='Ready for Dev'" } }
{ "queue": { "type": "gitlab_label",    "name":  "worktrain" } }
```

For the workrail repo specifically: either `github_assignee` (accept the conflation between your personal assignments and WorkTrain's queue -- fine for a solo repo) or `github_label` (apply label per issue -- more discipline, more friction). Neither is wrong; pick based on preference.

**Enterprise implications that must be resolved before Zillow work:**

Three questions to verify before designing any Zillow path:

1. **Service account process**: Does Zillow have a ServiceDesk or security review process for requesting service accounts (`worktrain-etienneb@zillow`)? If yes, request through proper channels rather than acting under personal identity.

2. **AUP check**: Does Zillow's Acceptable Use Policy permit automation acting under employee identities without explicit security review? If not, "WorkTrain acts as you" is not viable.

3. **Self-approval rules**: Can you approve your own MRs in Zillow's GitLab? If "no self-approval" is enforced, every WorkTrain MR needs a human reviewer. That changes the pipeline entirely (no auto-merge under personal identity).

**Enterprise identity risk:** "WorkTrain acts as you" is different from "Dependabot acts as you." Dependabot does narrow, predictable operations (dependency bumps). WorkTrain does arbitrary LLM-driven code changes. Every autonomous action is attributed to you in audit logs. Understand this risk before turning on autonomy against company repos.

**Jira return path (missing from current jira_poll design):** The `jira_poll` entry describes pulling tickets from Jira but not writing back -- moving ticket to "In Review" when MR is opened, adding MR URL to the Jira ticket, reacting to Jira transitions mid-work. The full Jira integration is a round-trip, not just a poll. Design the return path before implementing `jira_poll`.

### Jira + GitLab integration for WorkTrain (Apr 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 7** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:1 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Most enterprise developers use Jira for tickets and GitLab for code hosting. WorkTrain should work in this environment without requiring GitHub or a bot account.

**What exists:** `gitlab_poll` trigger already exists -- polls GitLab MR list and dispatches sessions when new/updated MRs appear. WorkTrain can already do autonomous MR review on GitLab.

**What's missing -- `jira_poll` trigger:** Poll a Jira board/sprint/filter for issues in a specific status (e.g. "In Progress", "Ready for Dev") assigned to the configured user, and dispatch WorkTrain sessions for them.

Proposed `jira_poll` config:
```yaml
- id: jira-queue
  provider: jira_poll
  jiraBaseUrl: https://zillow.atlassian.net
  token: $JIRA_API_TOKEN
  project: ACEI
  statusFilter: "Ready for Dev"
  assigneeFilter: "$JIRA_USERNAME"
  workspacePath: /path/to/repo
  branchStrategy: worktree
  autoCommit: true
  autoOpenPR: true
  agentConfig:
    maxSessionMinutes: 90
```

**Also missing:** GitLab issue queue -- same as `github_queue_poll` but for GitLab issues.

**Implementation notes:** `jira_poll` follows the same `PollingSource` discriminated union pattern as `gitlab_poll` and `github_queue_poll`. Jira REST API v3: `GET /rest/api/3/search?jql=project=X+AND+status="Ready for Dev"+AND+assignee=currentUser()`. `jira_poll` should extract issue title + description as the goal, and the Jira issue URL as `upstreamSpecUrl` in `TaskCandidate`.

**Things to hash out:**
- How should the return path work -- when WorkTrain opens a PR, should `jira_poll` automatically transition the Jira ticket to "In Review" and attach the PR URL? Who owns specifying that behavior?
- Jira Cloud vs Jira Server/Data Center have different REST API versions and auth flows. Which variant is in scope first?
- Jira JQL filters can be arbitrarily complex. Should `jira_poll` expose a raw `jql` field, or only structured filters like `statusFilter` + `assigneeFilter`? What are the safety tradeoffs?
- How is deduplication handled? Jira issue IDs must be used as the `sourceId` to prevent re-dispatch when the poll runs again with the issue still in the same status.
- Should GitLab issue queue share the same config schema as `jira_poll`, or be a separate provider? How much should they be unified?

### MR/PR template support (Apr 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain opens PRs using a generic body format hardcoded in `delivery-action.ts`. Teams maintain `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (GitHub), `.gitlab/merge_request_templates/` (GitLab), or custom templates -- WorkTrain ignores all of them. PRs opened by WorkTrain look structurally different from human-authored PRs and skip required fields (checklists, reviewer guidelines, linked issue fields).

**What needs to happen:** Before `gh pr create`, `delivery-action.ts` should check for a PR/MR template in standard locations (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/*.md`, `.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Default.md`). If a template exists: merge the agent's `HandoffArtifact.prBody` into the template structure.

**Recommended approach:** Pass the template to the agent's final step as additional context. The final step already produces the `HandoffArtifact.prBody` -- inject the template there so the agent fills it out correctly rather than trying to merge post-hoc.

Should land before WorkTrain is used in team repos with strict PR templates.

**Things to hash out:**
- Some repos have multiple PR templates keyed by branch prefix or PR type. How does WorkTrain select the right template when more than one exists?
- Template injection into the final step prompt may push the context window into uncomfortable territory for large templates. Is there a size budget for injected template content?
- Who is responsible for updating the injected template when the repo's template changes? Is this pulled fresh at dispatch time, or cached?
- GitLab MR templates have a different discovery path than GitHub PR templates. Should both providers be handled by the same abstraction, or is each provider responsible for its own template resolution?
- Should WorkTrain ever skip template injection if the agent's own `prBody` output already satisfies the template structure? Or is injection always mandatory?

### triggers.yml: composable configuration for multi-workspace support (Apr 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Single `triggers.yml` works well for one workspace. Becomes boilerplate-heavy as more repos are added. Each new repo needs a full trigger block repeating shared fields. The file mixes two concerns: **what to watch** (source, provider, repo, token, poll interval) and **what to do** (workflow, branch strategy, delivery, timeouts).

**Proposed direction: two-layer config**

Layer 1 -- trigger templates (global defaults):
```yaml
defaults:
  coding-pipeline:
    branchStrategy: worktree
    baseBranch: main
    branchPrefix: "worktrain/"
    autoCommit: true
    autoOpenPR: true
    agentConfig:
      maxSessionMinutes: 120
      maxTurns: 60
```

Layer 2 -- per-workspace overrides:
```yaml
triggers:
  - id: self-improvement
    extends: coding-pipeline
    provider: github_queue_poll
    workspacePath: /path/to/repo
    source:
      repo: owner/repo
      token: $WORKTRAIN_BOT_TOKEN
```

**Alternative:** per-workspace discovery -- WorkTrain scans each configured `workspaceRoots` entry for `.workrail/triggers.yml`. This is the GitHub Actions model -- one file per workflow per repo. Global `~/.workrail/triggers.yml` defines cross-workspace triggers.

Essential before WorkTrain manages more than 2-3 repos.

**Things to hash out:**
- If a workspace-local `.workrail/triggers.yml` and the global `~/.workrail/triggers.yml` both define a trigger with the same ID, which wins? Is this a conflict or a merge?
- Secrets (tokens, webhook secrets) in workspace-local triggers.yml files would be committed to the repo if the file is checked in. What is the recommended secret injection story for per-workspace config?
- When extending a named default template, what fields can be overridden vs. must be set? Are there fields that are always inherited and cannot be changed per-workspace?
- Is per-workspace discovery opt-in or the default behavior? Changing the default could break existing single-file setups.
- How does the daemon know which workspace paths to scan if it doesn't already have a configured workspace list?

### Demo repo feedback loop: WorkTrain improves itself via real task execution (Apr 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 12** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:3 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Run WorkTrain against a real demo repo, observe what breaks, automatically file issues against the workrail repo, and have WorkTrain fix them. A self-improving feedback loop that surfaces real production failures faster than any manual testing.

**The loop:**
```
Demo repo tasks (worktrain:ready issues)
  -> WorkTrain runs full pipeline: discover -> shape -> code -> PR -> review -> merge
  -> Failure classifier watches daemon event log
  -> For each failure: structured issue filed against workrail repo
     (what task, what step, what went wrong, session ID, relevant log lines)
  -> worktrain-etienneb assigned -> WorkTrain fixes itself
  -> WorkTrain re-runs the failed task -> confirms fix
```

**Phase 1:** Pick a demo repo (real TypeScript project, diverse tasks), add 5-10 `worktrain:ready` issues, run WorkTrain on them, manually supervise first runs, collect failure patterns.

**Phase 2:** Failure classifier -- scheduled session that reads `~/.workrail/events/daemon/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`, classifies sessions by outcome, for each non-success creates a GitHub issue against the workrail repo with structured failure context. ~100-150 LOC in `src/coordinators/failure-classifier.ts`.

**Phase 3:** Auto-rerun after fix -- when WorkTrain merges a fix for a failure issue, the failure classifier re-queues the original demo task. Confirms the fix actually resolved the failure.

**Relationship to benchmarking:** the same 10 demo tasks run after each WorkTrain release become a regression benchmark. Track: % completing successfully, fix loop iterations needed, LLM turns per task, token cost per task.

**Things to hash out:**
- Who chooses the demo repo and the demo tasks? What makes a task representative vs a toy example?
- How does the failure classifier distinguish a WorkTrain bug from a task that is genuinely ambiguous or underdefined? Misclassification would create noise in the self-improvement loop.
- What is the blast radius if the self-improvement loop files a bad issue against workrail and WorkTrain acts on it autonomously? Who reviews auto-filed issues before they enter the queue?
- How many re-run attempts per task before the loop gives up and escalates to a human?
- Token cost of running 10 demo tasks per release could be significant. Is there a policy for how often the benchmark suite runs?
- How does this interact with branch protection and CI? WorkTrain fixing itself creates PRs -- someone or something must review and merge them.

A 55-minute discovery session that reads the full codebase and produces zero step advances gets silently discarded on crash -- the `evaluateRecovery()` function returns 'discard' with no other signals. This is a real loss for overnight sessions. The "borderline" case (0 advances but > 5 LLM turns) is documented in this item as a "things to hash out" question but is not yet implemented. The current code does not distinguish between "crashed in the first 30 seconds" and "crashed after 55 minutes of work." See the existing "Session is at step 0 with 0 advances but > 5 LLM turns: borderline" criterion above -- this should be the next extension to `evaluateRecovery()`.

**The problem:** A daemon crash loop kills all in-flight sessions. The queue correctly detects the sidecar and skips re-dispatch for the TTL window, but when the sidecar expires the session is re-dispatched from scratch with zero context. An agent that spent 10 min in Phase 0, read codebase files, and formed a plan loses all of that work.

**What we want:** WorkTrain detects orphaned sessions on startup and makes an autonomous decision: resume if meaningful progress was made, discard and re-dispatch from scratch if too early to be worth resuming.

**Resumability decision criteria:**
- Session had >= 1 `continue_workflow` call (at least one step advance): worth resuming
- Session is at step 0 with 0 advances but > 5 LLM turns: borderline -- context accumulated but no checkpoint. Surface to console for human decision.
- Session is at step 0, < 5 turns, < 2 min: discard -- nothing was lost
- Session's worktree is missing or corrupted: discard -- can't resume cleanly
- Session is on a coding workflow and has uncommitted changes in the worktree: pause for human review before discarding

**`session-recovery-policy.ts`** (pure function) already exists -- extend `evaluateRecovery()` to surface the `human_review` case.

**`worktrain session resume <sessionId>` CLI** -- manual override for human-initiated resume when the daemon's automatic heuristic chose to discard but the user sees partial work worth keeping.

**Queue sidecar TTL for resume vs. discard:** for a discarded session, the TTL should be short (5 min) so the queue can quickly re-select. For a resumed session, keep the full TTL and extend it by the time already spent.

**Things to hash out:**
- When a session resumes after a crash, does the agent receive any signal that recovery happened? Should it be told explicitly so it can reorient, or is silent resumption preferable?
- If the agent crashed mid-tool-call (e.g. mid-Bash), what is the state of the file system? Does the recovery policy need to account for partially executed side effects?
- How is "meaningful progress" determined for sessions on non-coding workflows where there are no worktree commits? Step advances are the primary signal -- is that sufficient?
- The `human_review` case (borderline progress) requires a console UI to present the decision. What is the fallback if the console is not running?
- If a session resumes and crashes again in the same place, how many retries before permanent discard? Is this configurable per workflow?
- How does crash recovery interact with the re-dispatch loop protection (`maxAttempts`)? A resumed session should not count against the attempt counter in the same way as a fresh dispatch.

### Coordinator-managed git state and agent crash recovery (Apr 21, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 11** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Git state management (coordinator's job):** Before dispatching any WorkTrain session that does git work:
1. Check for `.git/index.lock` -- if present, verify the owning PID is dead (via `lsof` on macOS), then remove it
2. Abort any in-progress git operations: `git rebase --abort; git merge --abort`
3. Verify the workspace is in a clean state before handing off to the agent

**Agent crash recovery (coordinator's job):** An agent can die from: stream watchdog timeout, OOM kill, or SIGKILL. In all cases the session event log is intact.

The coordinator should detect and recover automatically:
1. Monitor child sessions via `worktrain await`
2. If a session returns `_tag: 'aborted'` or `_tag: 'timeout'` mid-pipeline: check if the session made meaningful progress (step advances > 0, or notes written). If yes: resume the session -- same session ID, same context, agent picks up at last checkpoint. If no (zero progress): retry from scratch with a fresh session, same context bundle.
3. Retry up to N times (configurable, default 2) before escalating to Human Outbox
4. Track which phase failed and inject a hint on retry: "Previous attempt failed at this step. Retry with fresh approach."

**This is session continuation applied to crash recovery.** The agent's conversation history is fully preserved. Resuming puts it back exactly where it was. The 600s watchdog timeout (most common failure) almost always means a hung LLM call or a tool timeout -- resuming naturally retries the step.

**Things to hash out:**
- If the coordinator monitors child sessions and detects a crash, what prevents it from retrying a session that crashed because of an unrecoverable environment issue (e.g. the workspace is on a network drive that is now offline)?
- The hint "Previous attempt failed at this step. Retry with fresh approach." assumes the agent can adapt its approach. What if the failure was infrastructure (OOM, timeout from provider) rather than a strategy error?
- How does the coordinator distinguish between a `_tag: 'aborted'` from a user kill-switch vs a crash? Retrying a kill-switched session may violate operator intent.
- Git state management before recovery: `.git/index.lock` cleanup requires knowing the owning PID is dead. On macOS this is `lsof`; on Linux it is different. Is cross-platform git recovery in scope?
- Should the coordinator attempt git state cleanup even when it did not originally dispatch the session (e.g. a session manually started via CLI)?
- Who owns the N-retry limit configuration -- the coordinator script, the trigger definition, or a daemon-level policy?

### Screenshot capture and ingestion for UI pipeline runs (May 13, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

When a pipeline run involves UI work, the agent currently has no way to see what it produced. It can read source code and run tests, but it cannot observe rendered output. A coding agent that implements a UI change cannot verify the result is visually correct without seeing it. The review agent reviewing a UI PR has the same blind spot -- it can catch structural issues in the diff but not broken layouts, missing states, or visual regressions.

This matters for the UX gate (FULL pipeline, `touchesUI: true`): the gate dispatches `wr.ui-ux-design` before coding, but if neither the coding agent nor the review agent can see the rendered result, the design spec is advisory at best.

**What's needed:** a mechanism for agents to (1) trigger a screenshot capture of the running application at a known URL or component, and (2) ingest that screenshot as a multimodal input so Claude's vision capability can be used to evaluate it. The agent could compare the rendered output to the design spec, verify loading/error states, and surface visual issues as findings.

**Things to hash out:**
- What captures the screenshot -- a Bash tool call to a headless browser (Playwright, Puppeteer), a `screenshot` tool primitive, or an external service?
- What is the trigger: agent-initiated (calls a tool), step-directive (step prompt instructs capture at a specific URL), or coordinator-initiated (coordinator captures before spawning the review session)?
- How does the agent receive the screenshot -- as a base64 artifact in the tool response, as a file path it then reads with the Read tool, or as a direct image content block in the next message?
- Should screenshot capture be a first-class daemon tool (like Bash/Read) or a capability that workflows declare in their `wr.features.*` section?
- What is the security boundary? Headless browser access means the agent can interact with any reachable URL. Is the scope restricted to localhost, or is broader access acceptable?
- How does this interact with the existing `wr.ui-ux-design` workflow -- should the design workflow produce a reference screenshot as part of its handoff artifact for the review agent to compare against?

**Relationship:** Closely coupled with the UX gate in the FULL pipeline and the UX/UI impact detection item below.

### UX/UI impact detection and design workflow integration (Apr 19, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs adaptive coordinator)

When the adaptive pipeline coordinator classifies a task, it should detect whether the task touches user-facing surfaces and automatically insert a `ui-ux-design-workflow` run before implementation.

**Why:** Coding tasks that touch UI get implemented without a design pass today. The agent writes functional code but often produces interfaces that are technically correct but experientially wrong -- wrong information hierarchy, wrong affordances, missing error states, missing loading states, wrong copy.

**Detection signals (`touchesUI: true`) when any of:**
- Issue title/body mentions: component, screen, page, modal, dialog, button, form, flow, onboarding, dashboard, navigation, UX, UI, design, user-facing, frontend, console, web
- Affected files include: `console/src/`, `*.tsx`, `*.css`, `web/`, `views/`
- The task has a `ui` or `frontend` label
- The upstream spec explicitly calls out visual or interaction design requirements

**Pipeline integration:** When `touchesUI: true`: `coding-task-classify -> ui-ux-design-workflow -> coding-task-workflow-agentic -> PR -> review -> merge`

**Open design questions:**
- Who reviews the design spec before coding starts? `complexity: Large AND touchesUI: true` → require human ack on the design spec before coding.
- Design this as part of the adaptive coordinator. The `touchesUI` flag belongs on the classification output alongside `taskComplexity` and `maturity`.
- What does "UI" mean for WorkRail specifically? The console is the only web surface -- does a change to `console/src/` always qualify, or only changes that affect user-visible interaction?
- Is false-positive `touchesUI` detection acceptable (wastes a design pass) or should the threshold be conservative to avoid unnecessary overhead?
- Should the `ui-ux-design-workflow` output be a gate (coding cannot start until design is approved) or advisory (coding proceeds in parallel)?
- Who is the design workflow audience -- the autonomous agent doing the coding, or a human reviewer? If the agent reads and follows the design spec itself, what prevents it from rationalizing the spec to fit what it already planned?

### Consider rewriting WorkRail engine in Kotlin (Apr 23, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: low / long-term

**Score: 6** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:1 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**The argument:** WorkRail's coding philosophy demands "make illegal states unrepresentable" and "type safety as the first line of defense." TypeScript is structurally at odds with this: the compiler is advisory, not enforcing. `as unknown as`, `any`, and type assertion casts are always one line away. In a codebase where autonomous agents write and merge code without deep human review, the compiler is the reviewer -- and TypeScript's escape hatches make it too easy to paper over a real design problem with a cast.

**What Kotlin actually buys:**
- **Sealed classes** -- exhaustive `when` is a compile error, not a runtime `assertNever` pattern that convention must enforce
- **No easy escape hatch** -- `as` in Kotlin throws at runtime on type mismatch; there's no equivalent of `as unknown as` that silently lies to the compiler
- **Null safety by default** -- `String` vs `String?` is a language distinction, not a `strict: true` compiler flag that can be turned off
- **Value classes and data classes** -- less boilerplate for domain types, stronger invariants

**What TypeScript + current tooling already covers:** Zod at boundaries provides runtime validation; `neverthrow` gives Result types; discriminated unions + `assertNever` give exhaustiveness -- but enforced by convention, not the compiler.

**Real costs:** JVM startup latency for an MCP server that starts/stops frequently (mitigable with GraalVM native image, but adds build complexity); full rewrite of `src/`; Console stays TypeScript/React regardless.

**The honest tradeoff:** Convention drift is a recurring tax. Migration is a one-time cost. In a codebase driven heavily by autonomous agents, the compiler is the last line of defense against accumulated drift. TypeScript's permissiveness means that defense has holes.

Not urgent -- the current codebase is working well. Worth revisiting when the agent is writing the majority of new code. Requires a concrete spike: rewrite one module (e.g. `src/v2/durable-core/domain/`) in Kotlin and measure the real friction before committing to a full migration.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the actual trigger condition? "Agent is writing the majority of new code" is vague -- what metric or event makes this evaluation happen?
- The Console is TypeScript/React and stays that way regardless. Does a partial Kotlin migration create a permanent two-language maintenance burden, or is the split clean enough to be manageable?
- GraalVM native image significantly reduces JVM startup time but adds build complexity and has known incompatibilities with reflection-heavy libraries. Is the build complexity acceptable for a project that ships frequently?
- Who owns the migration decision? This is a significant architectural commitment -- should it require explicit project owner sign-off rather than being decided by the agent autonomously?
- Are there TypeScript-specific patterns in the current codebase (e.g. `neverthrow`, discriminated unions) that would lose expressiveness in Kotlin, or would Kotlin actually improve them?

### Auto-start mechanism inventory (Apr 23, 2026)

**Status: resolved** | Documented for reference

Current auto-start mechanisms for WorkTrain daemon (as of current branch -- no auto-start):

The launchd plist (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.worktrain.daemon.plist`) no longer has `RunAtLoad` or `KeepAlive` keys (removed on current branch). The daemon must be started explicitly:
- `worktrain daemon --install` -- Register with launchd (no auto-start)
- `worktrain daemon --start` -- Start the daemon explicitly
- `worktrain daemon --stop` -- Stop the daemon
- `worktrain daemon --status` -- Check if running
- `worktrain daemon --uninstall` -- Remove registration

**Known operational note:** When working on daemon code, always `--stop` first then `--start` after rebuild. A running daemon does not automatically pick up a rebuilt binary.

### Post-update onboarding: contextual feature announcements

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 7** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

When WorkTrain updates to a new version with significant new capabilities, it prompts the user to configure the new feature -- once, the first time they run after updating.

**How it works:** Each significant feature ships with a migration step keyed to a minimum version:
```json
{
  "onboardingCompleted": "3.17.0",
  "featureStepsCompleted": ["daemon-soul", "bedrock-setup", "triggers-v2"]
}
```

On startup, WorkTrain checks: current version > `onboardingCompleted`? Any new `featureSteps` not in `featureStepsCompleted`? If yes, run those steps interactively before continuing.

Each step takes < 60 seconds. Show what changed, ask what's needed, confirm it works. Skip if already configured. Only triggers on: new capabilities that require user configuration, breaking config format changes, valuable opt-in features that are off by default. Does NOT trigger on: bug fixes, new workflows in the library, anything that works without user input.

**Things to hash out:**
- How does the onboarding system know which features require user configuration vs which just work? Is this metadata shipped with each feature, or manually curated?
- What happens if onboarding is interrupted mid-step (user closes the terminal)? Is the partial state safe to resume, or does it restart from the beginning?
- Should onboarding steps ever be re-runnable for reconfiguration, or is each step a one-time operation?
- Who authors and maintains the onboarding steps? Are they coupled to release engineering, or can feature authors ship their own?
- Is there a risk that forced onboarding after update creates friction that causes users to downgrade or skip updates?

### Bundled trigger templates: zero-config workflow automation via worktrain init (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 11** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

Every user has to write their own triggers.yml manually. Wrong workflow IDs, missing required fields, wrong workspace paths -- all common mistakes. There's no "just works" path to workflow automation.

**Solution:** Ship common trigger templates bundled with WorkTrain. `worktrain init` presents a menu and generates a pre-filled triggers.yml.

**Bundled templates:**
```yaml
# mr-review, coding-task, discovery-task, bug-investigation
# (with correct workflowIds, sensible defaults, and example config)
```

**`worktrain init` flow:**
1. "Which workflows do you want to run automatically?" (checkbox menu)
2. For each selected: set `workspacePath` to current directory (overridable)
3. Generate `triggers.yml` in the workspace root
4. Validate workflow IDs exist before writing
5. Tell the user how to fire each trigger: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3200/webhook/<id> ...`

**Also needed:** `worktrain trigger add <template-name>` to add a single trigger to an existing triggers.yml without re-running init.

The difference between WorkTrain being usable by anyone vs only by engineers who read the source code. A new user should be able to go from `worktrain init` to their first automated workflow in under 5 minutes.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the scope of `worktrain init` -- does it also set up the daemon, configure the soul file, and validate credentials, or is it only for trigger template generation?
- When `worktrain trigger add` adds to an existing `triggers.yml`, what happens if the file has non-standard formatting or includes custom YAML anchors? Does the tool preserve or clobber them?
- Templates embed sensible defaults (e.g. `maxSessionMinutes: 90`). Who decides what "sensible" means, and how are those defaults kept in sync when the underlying constraints change?
- Should bundled templates be versioned separately from the WorkTrain binary, so they can be updated without a full release?
- If a template generates a trigger pointing to a workflowId that the user's WorkRail installation does not have (e.g. a custom workflow), how is that error surfaced?

### Decouple goal from trigger definition -- late-bound goals (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: done** | Shipped (already implemented in trigger-store.ts)

**Score: 12** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:3 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

`trigger-store.ts` already implements the default `goalTemplate: "{{$.goal}}"` behavior (lines 766-773): when a trigger has neither `goal` nor `goalTemplate` configured, the loader injects `goalTemplate: "{{$.goal}}"` automatically and logs an informational warning. The webhook payload's `goal` field is the canonical way to pass a dynamic goal. Zero breaking changes, backward compatible.

The right long-term evolution (coordinator-spawned sessions needing richer context beyond a goal string) is tracked under "Coordinator context injection standard" and "Subagent context packaging".

**Preferred fix (Option 1 -- default goalTemplate):** if no `goal` is set in the trigger and no `goalTemplate` is set, default to `goalTemplate: "{{$.goal}}"`. The webhook payload's `goal` field becomes the canonical way to pass a dynamic goal. Zero breaking changes, backward compatible.

Most real-world triggers (PR review, issue investigation, incident response) have dynamic goals that depend on what just happened. Static goals in triggers.yml only work for scheduled/cron tasks. Late-bound goals make the whole trigger system composable with external events.

**Things to hash out:**
- If `goalTemplate: "{{$.goal}}"` is the default, what happens when the webhook payload omits the `goal` field entirely? Should the dispatch fail, fall back to the trigger ID, or use an empty string?
- How does this interact with `dispatchCondition`? A missing goal field might also indicate a structurally unexpected payload.
- Should late-bound goals apply to polling triggers as well (where the goal is derived from the polled item), or only webhooks?
- Is there a security concern with allowing arbitrary webhook payload fields to become the session goal without sanitization?

### FatalToolError: distinguish recoverable from non-recoverable tool failures (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 9** | Cor:2 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The blanket try/catch in `AgentLoop._executeTools()` converts ALL tool throws to `isError: true` tool results. This is correct for Bash/Read/Write (LLM can see and retry), but potentially wrong for `continue_workflow` failures (LLM retrying with a broken token loops).

**Fix:** `FatalToolError` subclass -- tools throw `FatalToolError` for non-recoverable errors (session corruption, bad tokens), plain `Error` for recoverable failures. `_executeTools` catches plain `Error` and returns `isError`; `FatalToolError` propagates and kills the session.

Combined with the `DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS` cap, this provides defense-in-depth against runaway loops on broken tokens.

**Things to hash out:**
- How does the tool author declare a failure as `FatalToolError` vs plain `Error`? Is this a convention, a type check, or a registration step?
- If the LLM retries a `FatalToolError` tool call because it didn't understand the result, is the second attempt also fatal? Or does the fatal classification only apply to specific error codes?
- How should the session outcome be recorded when killed by a `FatalToolError`? Is it different from a stuck/timeout outcome in the event log?
- Should `FatalToolError` be surfaced to the console with a distinct visual treatment so operators can distinguish infrastructure failures from agent logic failures?

### Branch dependency tracking: prevent accidental stacking and handle intentional stacking correctly (May 8, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 12** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain creates branches and opens PRs without tracking whether a branch was created from main or from another in-flight PR branch. When a branch is accidentally based on a pending PR branch, two problems follow: (1) squash-merging the base PR absorbs the dependent PR's commits, making the dependent PR either empty or conflicted; (2) CI on the dependent PR tests the combined diff, not just the intended change. This has already caused real merge failures and required manual rebases. When stacking is intentional (PR B genuinely depends on PR A), WorkTrain has no mechanism to enforce merge order or automatically rebase B after A lands.

**Things to hash out:**
- Should WorkTrain enforce "always branch from main" as a hard rule, or support intentional stacking with explicit dependency metadata?
- If stacking is allowed, what is the right representation for a stack dependency -- a field in the session store, a git note, or a GitHub PR relationship?
- When the base PR merges, who is responsible for rebasing dependents -- the coordinator, a post-merge hook, or a separate `worktrain rebase` command?
- What should happen to a dependent branch mid-session when its base merges? Should the daemon interrupt the session, or let it finish and rebase at the end?

### Worktree and branch lifecycle management (May 12, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain has no tooling to surface the state of worktrees and branches relative to main. Worktrees persist after their branch's PR is squash-merged with no signal that they are safe to delete. No inventory of which branches have genuinely unmerged work vs. fully superseded content. Daemon-spawned worktrees under `~/.workrail/worktrees/` are opaque -- no indication of which session created them or whether cleanup is safe.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the authoritative source of truth for "is this worktree safe to delete" -- the session store, the git graph, or both?
- Squash-merged branches leave no ancestry trace. What is the detection mechanism? PR close status via GitHub API, or file-content comparison with main?
- Should the inventory tool be reactive (shows current state on demand) or proactive (daemon monitors and alerts when stale worktrees accumulate)?

### Startup recovery for coordinator-owned pipeline worktrees (May 12, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:2 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The daemon's startup recovery scans `DAEMON_SESSIONS_DIR` for orphaned session sidecars and reaps their worktrees. But coordinator-owned pipeline worktrees (`~/.workrail/worktrees/<runId>`) are not linked to session sidecars -- they're linked to pipeline context files (`{workspace}/.workrail/pipeline-runs/{runId}-context.json`). A daemon crash between `createPipelineWorktree` and `createPipelineContext` leaves an orphaned worktree with no automated cleanup. Accumulates silently.

**Things to hash out:**
- Scan `pipeline-runs/` for in-progress context files and check if their `worktreePath` still exists -- any path that exists but has no live pipeline run is eligible for cleanup.
- Age threshold: same 24h as session worktrees, or different?
- Should cleanup be part of `runStartupRecovery()` or a separate scheduled GC?

### worktrain run pipeline CLI agentConfig and branchStrategy forwarding (May 12, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 7** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:3 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The `worktrain run pipeline` CLI command dispatches sessions via HTTP to the daemon's `/api/v2/auto/dispatch` endpoint. The HTTP endpoint doesn't accept `agentConfig` or `branchStrategy` -- those come from the trigger definition on the daemon side. So per-phase timeouts (discovery=60min, coding=65min) and worktree isolation are silently dropped when running the pipeline via CLI. Sessions fall back to the daemon's trigger defaults instead of the coordinator's phase-specific config.

**Things to hash out:**
- Extend `/api/v2/auto/dispatch` to accept `agentConfig` (maxSessionMinutes, maxTurns) as request body fields and forward them to the spawned session.
- Or: accept that CLI pipeline runs use trigger defaults and document the limitation.

### Cognitive Verification & Subagent-Driven Auditing (June 1, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 12** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

Currently, verification step configurations require hardcoded shell commands or specific commands in the workflow definition. This compromises platform-agnosticism across bundled workflows, and treats the agent as a passive script-runner instead of an autonomous problem-solver. Furthermore, auditing a step's output is performed by the same agent session, which suffers from confirmation bias and self-justification.

The system needs to shift towards cognitive/agentic verification instructions and parallel subagent auditing:
1. **Cognitive Verification**: Allow verification configurations to be completely command-free, instructing the main agent to autonomously identify, run, write, and establish test/build verification systems to prove correctness in their workspace.
2. **Subagent-Driven Auditing**: Enable the `verification` and `audit` configuration blocks to specify a subagent spawning directive. When hit, the engine suspends the main parent session, programmatically spawns an independent, sandboxed subagent QA auditor to inspect the parent's work, code diffs, and artifacts, and returns an objective Pass/Fail verdict with remediation guidance.

**Things to hash out:**
- How does the parent agent pass the precise context and target code changes to the subagent QA auditor?
- Should the subagent QA auditor run in the exact same workspace worktree, or in a branched worktree to prevent hot-path mutations during parallel checks?
- What standardized response schema (e.g. `Pass/Fail` plus `remediationNotes`) should the spawned auditing subagent return to the parent workflow to resume execution?

### Parallel tool execution in AgentLoop (May 11, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:3 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

`AgentLoop._executeTools()` runs a sequential `for` loop regardless of how many tool_use blocks the LLM returns in a single response. `toolExecution: 'sequential'` is the only accepted value. When the LLM requests multiple reads, globs, or greps in one turn, they execute one by one.

This is fine for tools with ordering requirements (`complete_step` must return the next prompt before Bash acts on it), but it is needlessly slow for independent I/O -- reading 5 files, running 3 greps, or fetching 4 URLs. Discovery and research workflows are the worst cases: they spend the majority of their turns on file reads that have zero ordering dependencies.

The fix is a `toolExecution: 'parallel'` strategy in `AgentLoop._executeTools()` that `Promise.all`s over the tool_use blocks when no ordering constraint exists. The sequential path stays as-is. Callers opt in via `AgentLoopOptions.toolExecution`.

**Design confirmed by Claude Code research (May 11, 2026, research/wr-research-ccloop-001/brief.md):**

Claude Code uses exactly this pattern. Key findings:
- Tool safety is **four-axis**, not binary: `isConcurrencySafe`, `isReadOnly`, `isDestructive`, `interruptBehavior` -- all per-invocation methods, all fail-closed defaults
- `partitionToolCalls()` groups consecutive `isConcurrencySafe=true` tools into one batch; singleton batches for non-safe tools
- `runToolsConcurrently(cap=10)` runs each batch via a bounded executor (implementation in `utils/generators.ts`, not yet fetched -- the cap=10 implementation details are unverified)
- **BashTool uses dynamic per-command analysis** (`checkReadOnlyConstraints()`) rather than a static flag -- needed for correct Bash classification

**Confirmed tool safety values:**
| Tool | isConcurrencySafe | isReadOnly |
|---|---|---|
| Read / FileReadTool | true | true |
| Glob | true | true |
| Grep | true | true |
| WebFetch / WebSearchTool | true | true |
| BashTool | dynamic (per-command) | dynamic |
| Edit / FileEditTool | false | false |
| Write / FileWriteTool | false | false |

**Implementation path (non-streaming, most adoptable):** add `isConcurrencySafe(): boolean` and `isReadOnly(): boolean` methods to `AgentTool` interface (fail-closed: default false), then wrap `_executeTools()` with `partitionToolCalls()` + `runToolsConcurrently()`. The sequential path remains as the fallback.

**Open question:** how `utils/generators.ts`'s `all()` implements the concurrency cap (semaphore? backpressure? simple Promise.all with limit?). Must fetch before implementing to avoid wrong cap semantics.

**Relationship to parallel spawn_agent:** `spawn_agent` solved this at the session-spawn level. This item solves it at the within-session tool level -- complementary.

**Expected impact:** wr.discovery sessions that read 20+ files per turn would complete in `max(file_read_times)` instead of `sum(file_read_times)`. Rough estimate: 30-50% wall-clock reduction on read-heavy phases.

### Token-velocity stuck detection: add diminishing-returns check as complement to repeated-tool-call heuristic (May 11, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 11** | Cor:2 Cap:1 Eff:3 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

WorkRail's current stuck detection catches the "spinning on the same tool call" failure mode (`repeated_tool_call` heuristic: same tool + same args 3x). It does not catch the "model producing diminishing output each turn" failure mode -- where the agent keeps calling the LLM but each response is smaller and less meaningful than the last.

Claude Code research (May 11, 2026, `research/wr-research-ccloop-001/brief.md`, Finding 5) confirmed Claude Code uses a `BudgetTracker` diminishing-returns check: if `continuationCount >= 3` AND the last two token deltas are both `< 500 tokens`, the loop stops. This catches sessions that are technically making progress (new tokens each turn) but producing nothing useful.

**Implementation:** Track the last N output token counts in the `AgentLoop` or in `SessionState`. After each LLM turn, check if `turnCount >= 3` and `lastTwoOutputTokenDeltas.every(d => d < 500)`. If true, fire the stuck signal with `reason: 'token_velocity'`. Subject to `stuckAbortPolicy` (abort vs notify_only) same as existing heuristics.

**The two heuristics are complementary, not competing:** `repeated_tool_call` catches "stuck on one tool call"; `token_velocity` catches "running but producing nothing". Both should be active.

**Note:** WorkRail's prior analysis ("Claude Code has more sophisticated stuck detection") was falsified by the research. Claude Code has NO dedicated stuck detector beyond these two mechanisms. WorkRail is not inferior -- it addresses a different failure mode. This item adds coverage of the second failure mode.

### Three-level AbortController hierarchy for parallel batch isolation (May 11, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 11** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: parallel tool execution backlog item

WorkRail's current abort model is two-level: session `AbortController` (propagated to LLM calls) and per-tool `AbortSignal` (passed to `tool.execute()`). When running tools in parallel batches (once the parallel tool execution item ships), a tool failure in the batch should abort sibling tools in the same batch -- but NOT abort the entire session. There is currently no "batch-scoped" abort level.

Claude Code research (May 11, 2026, `research/wr-research-ccloop-001/brief.md`, Finding 3) confirmed Claude Code uses a three-level hierarchy: **session AbortController > siblingAbortController (scoped per concurrent batch) > per-tool controller**. Key asymmetry: only `BashTool` errors cascade to sibling batch members -- read-tool errors do not. This allows batch-level error isolation without killing the session.

**Implementation:** When `runToolsConcurrently()` executes a batch, create a `siblingAbortController` scoped to that batch. If a Bash tool throws (or returns `isError: true` with a fatal result), signal `siblingAbortController` to abort sibling tools still in-flight. Read/Glob/Grep errors do NOT cascade. Session `AbortController` is unchanged -- only the batch-scoped controller is signaled.

**Blocked by:** parallel tool execution item (no batches = no batch-scoped abort needed).

### State-of-the-code context: pass diffs or transformations instead of full file contents (May 11, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 11** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Agents currently read entire files to understand what the code looks like. On long sessions they re-read the same files repeatedly as context compacts -- each re-read consumes tokens proportional to file size rather than to what actually changed. The mental model the agent needs is not "what does this file look like" but "what did this file look like at the start, and what transformations have been applied since."

**The core idea:** instead of injecting full file contents into the agent's context, inject a compact representation of code state as a sequence of transformations:

- **Initial snapshot + diffs**: agent gets `file at session start` + `diff --unified` for each subsequent edit. Reading a 400-line file + three 20-line diffs is cheaper than re-reading the 400-line file four times.
- **Semantic edit log**: instead of raw diffs, a structured log of named operations (`renamed function foo -> bar`, `extracted method baz from qux`, `added field X to interface Y`). This is higher-level than a diff and more token-efficient on large refactors.
- **Incremental context injection**: the agent starts the session with a snapshot; each edit event appends a small delta. The agent always has a current view without re-reading.

**Why this matters for WorkTrain specifically:** daemon sessions run for 30-60 minutes on large codebases. The coding-task workflow has a `session state recap` mechanism for step notes, but nothing equivalent for code state. An agent that edited 5 files in phase 1 has no compact way to re-orient to what it changed when phase 2 starts a fresh context window.

**Things to hash out:**
- Where does the transformation log live? In the WorkRail session store (as a new event type), in the agent's context variables, or as a sidecar file the agent writes to?
- What is the unit of a "transformation"? File-level diffs are easy to generate but verbose. Semantic operations (rename, extract, add field) are compact but require parsing.
- Does the agent write the transformation log itself (best-effort natural language) or does the daemon infer it from file-before/after hashes?
- Is this a workflow authoring concern (authors declare which files to track) or a daemon infrastructure concern (all file writes are automatically tracked)?
- How does this interact with the `Read` tool's read-before-write enforcement and `FileStateTracker`? The tracker already knows which files were read -- it could potentially emit deltas on write.

**Related:** `FileStateTracker` in `src/daemon/session-scope.ts` already tracks per-session file read state (content + timestamp). Extending it to also track write state (diff since last read) would be the natural implementation seam.

### Coordinator-managed typed output vocabulary: agent emits typed events, coordinator reacts per type (May 7, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 12** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Today, agent output is largely untyped -- notes, artifacts, context keys. The coordinator reacts to typed handoff artifacts at phase boundaries, but within a session the agent's observations, decisions, findings, and suggestions are all prose. The coordinator cannot programmatically react to them.

The idea: the coordinator owns a vocabulary of typed output kinds that it supports. Before a session starts, it injects that vocabulary into the agent's context -- the agent knows exactly what typed things it can emit and what each one means. When the agent emits a typed output, the coordinator reacts with the appropriate process for that type. The reaction is deterministic coordinator logic (not LLM reasoning), specified per type.

**Examples of typed output kinds and coordinator reactions:**

- `suggestion(kind: "abstraction_extraction")` → coordinator fires targeted verification: "what are the three future cases this serves?"
- `finding(severity: "critical", area: "security")` → coordinator routes to immediate review, may block merge
- `decision(chose: X, over: Y, rationale: ...)` → coordinator checks for conflicts with prior decisions in the session store
- `scope_change(direction: "larger", reason: ...)` → coordinator re-evaluates task complexity, may re-route to a heavier workflow
- `blocker(kind: "missing_context", what: ...)` → coordinator attempts to resolve the blocker from known sources before surfacing to operator
- `learning(claim: ..., area: ..., confidence: ...)` → coordinator writes to the assumption store for future sessions
- `assumption(claim: ..., severity: ...)` → coordinator gates on verification before proceeding (Candidate 5 is a specific instance of this)

**What makes this powerful:**
The agent doesn't need to know what happens next when it emits a typed output -- that's the coordinator's job. The agent just has to recognize "this is an assumption I'm making" or "this is a scope change I'm noticing" and emit the right type. The coordinator's reaction logic handles the rest deterministically, without LLM turns.

**Relationship to existing entries:**
- "Typed suggestion artifacts with workflow-directed verification" (below): a specific application of this pattern to suggestions
- "Coordinator mid-session hooks": the coordinator's reaction to typed outputs is exactly a mid-session hook triggered by a specific event type
- "Candidate 5 / interpretation checkpoint": the assumption verification step is a manually-implemented instance of this pattern for one output type
- "Coordinator session store awareness": the coordinator's reaction to a `learning` or `decision` type can write to the session store for future sessions

**Things to hash out:**
- Who defines the vocabulary of supported types -- the engine (closed set), the workflow author (per-workflow), or the coordinator (per-deployment)?
- How does the agent learn what types are available? Injected in the system prompt, declared in the workflow, or both?
- What is the API surface for emitting a typed output? A dedicated tool, a structured artifact field, a reserved context key pattern?
- How are reactions defined? TypeScript in the coordinator script, declarative rules in triggers.yml, or something else?
- What happens when the agent emits a type the coordinator doesn't handle? Silent drop, warning, or error?
- Should typed outputs be visible in the console as first-class events, or only in the raw session log?

### Typed suggestion artifacts with workflow-directed verification (May 7, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 11** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Agents frequently make suggestions mid-workflow -- propose an abstraction, recommend a deferral, flag a scope expansion, suggest a performance optimization. Today these live in plain prose notes. The workflow cannot distinguish one type of suggestion from another, cannot apply targeted follow-up logic, and cannot verify that the suggestion was actually scrutinized before being accepted. A suggestion that warrants architectural review gets the same treatment as one that warrants nothing.

The idea: a typed `suggestion` tool call that the agent makes instead of embedding the suggestion in prose. The artifact carries a `kind` field (closed enum, workflow-declared) that tells the engine what type of suggestion this is. The workflow author declares, per suggestion kind, what verification the engine should require before the suggestion is accepted.

**Example suggestion kinds and their natural follow-up scrutiny:**
- `abstraction_extraction` -- "is this premature? what are the three concrete future cases this serves? does any of them exist in the current backlog? does this introduce coupling that didn't exist before?"
- `architectural_change` -- "does this conflict with any design locks? what breaks downstream?"
- `scope_expansion` -- "is this actually in scope? is this the scope rationalization failure mode -- the agent declaring it's a separate ticket to avoid doing the work?"
- `deferral` -- "is this genuinely separate work, or is the agent completing checkboxes while leaving real work undone?"
- `performance_optimization` -- "is this premature? what is the actual measured bottleneck? what evidence justifies this now?"

**Mechanism:** fits naturally with the assessment gate system. A `suggestion_quality` assessment with dimensions specific to the suggestion kind. The workflow author declares which dimensions apply to each kind. When the agent emits a typed suggestion, the engine fires a `require_followup` consequence requiring the agent to answer the verification criteria for that kind before proceeding. If the agent cannot answer them satisfactorily, the suggestion does not pass.

**API shape is open:** the typed suggestion could be a dedicated tool call (`suggest(type: "abstraction_extraction", ...)`), a structured artifact field in `continue_workflow`, a special context key, or something else entirely. The key property is that it is machine-readable and has a `kind` field the engine can act on -- not prose. The exact surface needs design work.

**The friction concern:** if suggestions require too much overhead, agents will stop surfacing them or bury them in prose to avoid the gate. The verification criteria must be targeted and lightweight -- not a full review pass, just the specific questions that matter for that kind. "What are the three future cases this abstraction serves?" is lightweight. "Run a full architecture review" is not.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the closed set of suggestion kinds for the initial version? Too many kinds creates complexity; too few misses the point.
- Should suggestion kinds be workflow-declared (each workflow author defines their own) or engine-owned (a closed set the engine enforces)? Engine-owned is more consistent but less flexible.
- How does the agent signal that a suggestion was considered and rejected, not just overlooked? A declined suggestion should be as visible as an accepted one.
- Does the verification happen inline (a `require_followup` on the same step) or as a separate verification step? Inline is lower friction; a separate step is more auditable.
- How does this interact with the existing `report_issue` mechanism? Some suggestions that fail verification should surface to the operator, not just loop back to the agent.

### WorkTrain as the canonical workflow author -- MCP as a derived runtime (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Today workflows are authored once and expected to work identically in both runtimes: the WorkRail MCP server (human-in-the-loop, Claude Code) and the WorkTrain daemon (fully autonomous, coordinator-driven). In practice they don't -- a workflow authored for human use has `requireConfirmation` gates that block autonomous execution, step prompts that assume the human is reading them, and phase structures that assume a single continuous session. Conversely, a workflow good for autonomous use has no natural pause points, produces typed structured outputs that humans find hard to read mid-session, and chains phases that a human might want to interrupt.

The current response is to author separate "agentic variants" (`wr.coding-task` vs `coding-task-workflow.agentic.v2`). This is the wrong direction: it creates duplicate maintenance burden, improvements to one don't propagate to the other, and it means there is no single source of truth for what a workflow does.

There should be one version of each workflow, not two. Improvements to one should benefit the other automatically. The self-improvement loop WorkTrain runs on its own workflows should produce better workflows for everyone, not just daemon sessions. The question is how to structure authorship and any adaptation layer so this is possible without forcing workflows into an awkward compromise that works poorly in both contexts.

**What this enables:** WorkTrain can autonomously improve workflows using `wr.workflow-for-workflows`, and those improvements automatically benefit MCP users. The self-improvement loop produces better workflows for everyone, not just daemon sessions. Workflow quality compounds because there is only one version to improve.

**Relationship to existing entries:**
- "Workflow runtime adapter: one spec, two runtimes" (Shared/Engine) is a narrower version of this idea focused on parallelism and `requireConfirmation` gates. This entry is about the authoring philosophy and source-of-truth question, not just the adapter mechanics.
- `wr.workflow-for-workflows` is how WorkTrain improves workflows autonomously -- this entry determines what it improves toward.

**Things to hash out:**
- What does the MCP conversion layer actually do? Adding pause points is straightforward. Adapting output formats (structured JSON → human-readable prose) may require active LLM translation, not just structural transformation.
- Some workflow steps are genuinely different between runtimes -- a step that spawns parallel child sessions in the daemon doesn't have a clean MCP equivalent. Does the conversion layer skip those, simulate them sequentially, or require the author to declare a fallback?
- If WorkTrain is the authoring target, existing workflows authored for MCP need migration. What is the migration path and who does it -- the author, WorkTrain itself, or a one-time script?
- How do `requireConfirmation` gates fit? In the daemon they are removed or auto-satisfied by the coordinator. In MCP they pause for the human. Does the workflow declare them or does the conversion layer infer them?
- Is the conversion layer purely structural (rearranging/omitting steps) or does it require understanding the semantic intent of each step?


### Improve commit SHA gathering consistency in wr.coding-task

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 9** | Cor:2 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

After fixing the primary cause (SHA footer referenced `continue_workflow` by name while daemon agents use `complete_step`), two structural gaps remain that prevent consistent SHA recording:

**Gap 1: SHA footer appears on every non-final step, including planning/design steps with no commits.** Agents correctly skip it on those steps, but the repetition trains them to suppress it reflexively -- including on implementation steps where it matters. Options to explore: inject only inside loop bodies tagged as implementation, add an opt-out flag to steps, or move the SHA reminder into the implementation step prompts directly in the workflow JSON.

**Gap 2: `phase-5-small-task-fast-path` has no correctly-wired final metrics step for Small tasks.** `isLastStep` resolves to `phase-7b-fix-and-summarize`, which has a `runCondition` that skips it for Small tasks. Small-task sessions never see the final metrics footer. Needs either: the final footer added directly to `phase-5`'s authored prompt, or `isLastStep` detection made context-aware (complex).

**Gap 3: No validation for `metrics_commit_shas`.** `checkContextBudget` validates `metrics_outcome` but not SHAs. Missing or partial arrays fail silently. A warning-level soft validation at the final step would at least surface the gap in logs.

The right fix is probably a combination of moving the SHA instruction into the implementation step prompts directly (removing it from the ambient footer entirely) and adding Gap 2's final footer to `phase-5`. That avoids any new engine machinery.

**Things to hash out:**
- Moving the SHA instruction into implementation step prompts means every implementation step must be identified and updated. Who owns the ongoing maintenance of keeping that instruction present in new steps added to the workflow?
- Gap 3's soft validation: what is the right signal when `metrics_commit_shas` is missing -- a log warning, a console callout, or a session outcome flag? What action should the operator take on seeing this signal?
- If the SHA footer is removed from the ambient footer entirely, what prevents other workflows from missing SHA collection? Is the ambient footer the right abstraction, or should SHA recording be an engine-level concern separate from prompts?

### `jumpIf`: conditional step jumps with per-target jump counter

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Problem:** Workflows with investigation or iterative refinement patterns (bug-investigation, mr-review) can exhaust their hypothesis set and reach an `inconclusive_but_narrowed` state with no structural way to restart an earlier phase. A `jumpIf` primitive would let any step conditionally restart execution from an earlier step when a context condition is met.

**Proposed design:**

```json
{
  "id": "phase-4b-loop-decision",
  "jumpIf": {
    "condition": { "var": "diagnosisType", "equals": "inconclusive_but_narrowed" },
    "target": "phase-2-hypothesis-generation-and-shortlist",
    "maxJumps": 2
  }
}
```

**Engine behavior:**
- When a step completes and its `jumpIf.condition` is met, the engine checks the per-session jump counter for `target`
- Counter is derived from the event log: count `jump_recorded` events where `toStepId === target` -- fully append-only and replayable
- If `counter < maxJumps`: append `jump_recorded` event, create fresh nodeIds for `target` and all subsequent steps, mint a new continueToken pointing at the fresh target node
- If `counter >= maxJumps`: jump is blocked, execution falls through to the next step (safety cap, not an error)

**Why this is safe:**
- `maxJumps` is a required field -- no unbounded loops possible
- Counter is derivable from the append-only event log -- no mutable state
- Fall-through on limit reached is predictable and operator-visible

**Open design questions:**
- `maxJumps` default if omitted -- probably require it explicitly (same as `maxIterations` on loops)
- DAG console rendering -- backward jumps create "re-entry" edges. Needs a distinct visual treatment
- Interaction with `runCondition` -- if a jumped-to step has a `runCondition` that evaluates false at re-entry time, does the engine skip it and advance?

**Scope when ready to implement:**
- `spec/workflow.schema.json`: add `jumpIf` to `standardStep`
- `spec/authoring-spec.json`: add authoring rule
- Compiler: validate `target` resolves to a reachable earlier step, `maxJumps >= 1`
- Engine (`src/v2/durable-core/`): new `jump_recorded` event kind, counter derivation, fresh nodeId creation on jump
- Console DAG: render jump edges distinctly

**Motivation workflow:** `wr.bug-investigation` -- when all hypotheses are eliminated and `diagnosisType === 'inconclusive_but_narrowed'`, jump back to phase 2 (hypothesis generation) with the eliminated theories in context, up to 2 times before falling through to validation/handoff.

### Versioned workflow schema validation

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium-high

**Score: 11** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

**Problem:** WorkRail validates workflow files against the schema bundled in the currently-running MCP binary. Binary too new rejects old workflows; binary too old rejects new workflows. Both cause silent disappearance from `list_workflows` with no explanation.

**The right fix:** Each workflow declares `"schemaVersion": 1` (integer). The binary ships validator copies for every schema version it supports. When loading a workflow, pick the validator matching the declared version.

**Load-time logic:**
1. Read `schemaVersion` (default 1 if absent -- legacy workflows)
2. If `schemaVersion === current`: validate against current schema directly
3. If `schemaVersion < current` (binary newer): validate against the declared schema version
4. If `schemaVersion > current` (binary too old): load leniently with warnings -- `additionalProperties: false` does not apply

**Decision (from Apr 23 audit):** v1 = current schema. The one historical breaking change (`assessmentConsequenceTrigger`, Apr 5) was fully contained within the bundled workflow corpus. No historical reconstruction needed.

**Files to change:** `spec/workflow.schema.json`, `spec/workflow.schema.v1.json` (snapshot), `src/application/validation.ts`, `src/types/workflow-definition.ts`, `workflow-for-workflows.json` (stamp `schemaVersion`), all bundled workflows.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the policy when a workflow with `schemaVersion > current` has fields that fail lenient loading -- should the workflow be skipped entirely or loaded partially?
- Should the binary ship all historical schema validator copies forever, or is there a deprecation window after which very old versions are dropped?
- How does `workrailVersion` (the "forever backward compat" idea elsewhere in the backlog) relate to `schemaVersion`? Are these the same concept or different tracking axes?
- External workflow authors who don't track WorkRail releases need to know how to set `schemaVersion`. Is the default-to-v1 behavior documented clearly enough?
- What prevents a workflow from declaring `schemaVersion: 999` to bypass validation entirely via the lenient path?

### Session continuation / "just keep talking"

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

A completed session is not dead -- the conversation is still in the event log. The only thing blocking continuation is the engine rejecting messages to sessions in `complete` state.

**The change:** Remove that gate. `worktrain session continue <sessionId> "<message>"` sends a message to a completed session. New events appended to the same log. Same session ID. The agent has full context of everything it ever did.

Context window overflow (very long sessions) is a separate optimization problem -- truncate oldest turns while keeping step notes. Don't solve it now.

**Things to hash out:**
- When a completed session is continued, what workflow state does the engine start from? Does the agent re-enter the workflow at the last step, or does continuation happen outside any workflow context?
- If continuation adds a `session_resumed` event, how should the console display the session? As an extended session or as a new one with a link back?
- Should `worktrain session continue` be available in both daemon and MCP contexts, or daemon-only where the context stays alive?
- What is the intended use case -- interactive follow-up questions, or coordinator-driven post-processing? The answer shapes the UX significantly.
- If a session is continued after its worktree has been cleaned up, what tools can the agent use? Does it get a fresh worktree, or is it context-only?

### Session as a living record: post-completion phases

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

A `session_completed` event means the original workflow is done -- not that the session can never receive new events. The event log is append-only: just keep appending. A post-completion interaction adds a `session_resumed` event, then new turns, then a new `session_completed`.

This is already how mid-run resume works. The same mechanism extends naturally to post-completion: rehydrate the completed state, append a new lightweight phase, run it, complete again.

**Richer automatic checkpoints:** Many session events should trigger a checkpoint automatically:
- `step_advanced` (already essentially a checkpoint)
- `signal_coordinator` fired (agent surfaced meaningful mid-step state)
- Worktree commit pushed (code state durable on remote)
- Coordinator steers the session (notable injection)
- `spawn_agent` child completes (parent has new information)

**Things to hash out:**
- Who decides what constitutes a "lightweight phase" added post-completion? Is this a new workflow, an ad-hoc prompt, or something else?
- How does the auto-checkpoint list interact with existing explicit `checkpoint_workflow` calls? Is there any risk of over-checkpointing causing storage bloat?
- If a coordinator resumes a session for post-completion processing, is the resumed session billed/attributed to the same source trigger?
- What is the retention and garbage collection policy for post-completion events appended to old sessions?

### Extensible output contract registration: coordinator-owned schemas, engine-enforced (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The engine's output contract registry (`ARTIFACT_CONTRACT_REFS` in `src/v2/durable-core/schemas/artifacts/index.ts`) is a closed list maintained in the engine source. Adding a new contract type requires modifying the engine: adding to the registry, implementing a validator in `artifact-contract-validator.ts`, and adding a Zod schema. This is the correct pattern today and works fine at 5 items. But as the pipeline gains more phase types, every new coordinator-domain artifact contract is an engine change. The registry is already mixed -- `review_verdict` and `discovery_handoff` are coordinator-domain artifacts registered there. At 15-20 items this becomes a maintenance burden and a coupling that is harder to justify.

The better long-term design: the engine owns the enforcement mechanism (validate presence and schema at `complete_step`) but not the schema definitions. Coordinator-domain contracts register their Zod schemas from outside the engine. The engine validates against whatever is registered without a hardcoded case per contract type.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the registration API? DI injection at startup (consistent with existing container pattern), a module-level call, or a config file?
- How does registration work at compile time vs runtime? Workflow compilation and `complete_step` validation happen at different points -- the registry must be available at both.
- Does this change the `workflowHash`? If registered schemas change, should the hash change? Does the hash include registered external schemas or only the workflow JSON?
- Should the existing 5 contracts migrate, or stay hardcoded? A two-tier system (some hardcoded, some registered) is confusing but migration is low priority.

### Artifact schemas should use passthrough, not strict -- engine should not block workflow-level enrichment (May 15, 2026)

**Status: done** | Shipped PR #1032 (May 18, 2026)

**Score: 12** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

All artifact Zod schemas in `src/v2/durable-core/schemas/artifacts/` (including `ReviewVerdictArtifactV1Schema`) use `.strict()`. This means any field a workflow author adds to an artifact -- file location, line number, causal attribution, remediation steps -- causes validation failure at `complete_step` and triggers the blocked-response path. The coordinator falls back to keyword scanning.

**Why this is wrong:** The engine's job is to enforce that coordinator-required fields are present and correctly typed. It is not the engine's job to prevent workflows from carrying additional context. `.strict()` inverts the coupling -- infrastructure constrains the application layer. A workflow that wants to emit `{ kind: 'wr.review_verdict', verdict: 'blocking', findings: [...], file: 'src/foo.ts', startLine: 42 }` should be able to do so; the coordinator reads what it needs and ignores the rest.

**The fix:** Replace `.strict()` with `.passthrough()` on all artifact schemas (or add explicit optional fields where the set is known). For `ReviewVerdictArtifactV1Schema` specifically, add optional fields to the per-finding schema: `file?: string`, `startLine?: number`, `endLine?: number`, `causalLink?: string`, `remediation?: string`. These are surfaced to the coordinator and stored in the session event log, enabling richer downstream tooling without any breaking change.

**Discovered during:** wr.mr-review v2.9.0 overhaul -- the updated Phase 6 verdict prompt wanted to include file/line/causalLink/remediation per finding in the typed artifact, but the strict schema forced those fields back into human-readable notes only, losing the machine-readable signal.

**Scope:**
- `src/v2/durable-core/schemas/artifacts/review-verdict.ts` -- primary target; add optional finding fields, change to passthrough
- `src/v2/durable-core/schemas/artifacts/` -- audit all other artifact schemas for the same issue
- `src/v2/durable-core/domain/artifact-contract-validator.ts` -- verify passthrough doesn't break validation logic
- Update `getBlockedMessage()` in `review-verdict.ts` to show the extended schema

**Things to hash out:**
- `.passthrough()` vs explicit optional fields: passthrough is simpler and most permissive; explicit optional fields are self-documenting and keep the type useful. Prefer explicit optional fields for known enrichment patterns (file/line/causal), passthrough for the general case.
- Does storing extra fields in the session event log affect `workflowHash` or session validation? Likely no -- the hash covers the workflow JSON, not artifact content. Verify.
- Related: [[extensible-output-contract-registration]] is the longer-term design for coordinator-owned schema registration. This fix is a prerequisite for that -- you can't have coordinator-owned schemas if the engine rejects anything not in its hardcoded list.

**Score: 10** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Workspace rules today are injected globally -- every session gets the same rules regardless of what the session is doing. This means PR-opening rules, issue-creation rules, commit message rules, and merge rules are all visible to a discovery session that will never do any of those things. Worse, a PR-opening step in a coding workflow doesn't get the rules injected precisely when it needs them -- they're diluted in the full rules blob. There is no mechanism to say "inject these rules only when the agent is about to open a PR" or "inject these rules only when creating a GitHub issue."

The idea: a rule declaration mechanism (either in the workflow step definition or in a workspace rules file) that tags rules by task type. At step execution time, the engine injects only the rules tagged for that step's declared task type. Examples: a step with `taskType: 'git.open_pr'` automatically receives PR-opening rules; a step with `taskType: 'github.create_issue'` receives issue-creation rules. Rules not tagged for the current task type are not injected into that step's prompt. This is complementary to the phase-scoped rules preprocessing item -- phase scoping is coarse-grained (coding vs review), task scoping is fine-grained (which specific action within a step).

**Things to hash out:**
- Where are task-scoped rules declared -- in the workflow step definition (`taskType` field), in a workspace rules file with tags, or both?
- What is the taxonomy of task types -- is it an open string, a closed enum, or a hierarchical namespace (e.g. `git.*`, `github.*`, `jira.*`)?
- Does this interact with the ephemeral per-turn injection idea? Task-scoped rules are a natural candidate for ephemeral injection -- visible when needed, not accumulated in history.
- Should task-scoped rules override or augment the global rules? What is the precedence and load order?
- Who authors the task-scoped rules -- the workflow author (in the workflow JSON) or the workspace operator (in a workspace rules file)? Both seem valid but have different ownership models.

### Rules preprocessing: normalize workspace rules before injection

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Problem:** WorkTrain injects all rules files raw into every agent's system prompt. A workspace with `.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.windsurf/rules/*.md`, and `AGENTS.md` might inject 10KB of rules into a discovery session that only needs 2KB.

**Design:** A `worktrain rules build` command that reads all IDE rules files from the workspace, deduplicates overlapping rules, categorizes by phase, and writes to `.worktrain/rules/`:
- `implementation.md`, `review.md`, `delivery.md`, `discovery.md`, `all.md`
- `manifest.json` -- which files exist, when generated, source files used

At session time: WorkTrain injects only the phase-relevant file.

**Things to hash out:**
- How does WorkTrain determine which pipeline phase a session corresponds to? Is this declared in the trigger, derived from the workflowId, or inferred from the step?
- What happens when a single session spans multiple phases (e.g. a workflow that does discovery + implementation in one run)? Does the injected rules file switch mid-session, or is one phase file chosen at dispatch time?
- Who authors and owns the `.worktrain/rules/` files -- the workspace team, the workflow author, or WorkTrain itself?
- Should the absence of a phase-specific file fall back to `all.md`, or be a silent no-op? Is a missing `implementation.md` a misconfiguration or an acceptable default?
- How does this interact with the existing `daemon-soul.md` and workspace AGENTS.md injection? What is the full load-order and precedence when all are present?

### True session status (live agent state in console)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium-high

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Problem:** The console currently infers session status from last event timestamp. WorkTrain has direct access to `DaemonRegistry`, `DaemonEventEmitter`, and turn-level events -- it should show true status.

**True session status taxonomy:**
- `active:thinking` -- LLM API call in progress
- `active:tool` -- tool executing (name visible)
- `active:idle` -- between turns, session in DaemonRegistry
- `stuck` -- stuck heuristic fired
- `completed:success/timeout/stuck/max_turns`
- `aborted` -- daemon killed mid-run
- `daemon:down` -- no recent heartbeat

Surface in: `worktrain status`, `worktrain health <sessionId>`, console session rows.

**Things to hash out:**
- The daemon has direct access to `DaemonRegistry`, but the console is a separate process reading the session store. How does live status reach the console without the daemon being a dependency for reading it?
- What is the polling or push mechanism for the console to get status updates? SSE from the daemon's HTTP endpoint, or a separate status file the daemon writes?
- How is `daemon:down` distinguished from "daemon is up but this session is not currently running"? What is the heartbeat protocol?
- Should `active:tool` surface the tool name? Some tool names (file paths, bash commands) could leak sensitive workspace content in the console UI.
- What is the retention policy for status events -- does the console show only the live state, or a history of status transitions?

### Model tier abstraction: cheap / medium / expensive (May 7, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 11** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**The problem:** Triggers hardcode provider-specific model IDs (`amazon-bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`). When inference profile naming conventions change, or when switching providers/regions, every trigger must be updated manually. The daemon's adaptive coordinator already makes implicit cost/quality tradeoffs (Haiku for routing, Sonnet for coding) but has no first-class mechanism to express them -- it's locked to whatever IDs are in `agentConfig.model`.

**The idea:** Introduce a tier abstraction. Triggers and workflow phases declare a tier (`cheap | medium | expensive`). The daemon resolves tiers to concrete model IDs from a tier map in `~/.workrail/config.json`. The adaptive coordinator picks tiers per phase: cheap for classification and routing, medium for coding, expensive for architectural review. Changing provider or region means updating the tier map once.

**Things to hash out:**
- Where does the tier map live? `~/.workrail/config.json` (global) vs. `triggers.yml` (per-workspace) vs. both with cascade.
- Does the tier map need to carry both a Bedrock and a direct-API model per tier, or does one path own the daemon?
- Should the adaptive coordinator receive the tier map as a dependency, or should it always spawn sessions with explicit `agentConfig.model` set by the coordinator?
- How do you handle models that exist on one provider but not another (e.g. Opus available on Bedrock but not direct API under certain rate limits)?

## WorkTrain Daemon -- Coordinator patterns

Coordinator design patterns for WorkTrain's autonomous pipeline.

### Remove `spawnAndAwait` dead code from `CoordinatorDepsImpl` (May 13, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 7** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:3 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

`spawnAndAwait` on `CoordinatorDepsImpl` has no production callers. The only callers are in the CLI path (`cli-worktrain.ts`) which implements it separately over HTTP -- they never call the in-process `CoordinatorDepsImpl.spawnAndAwait`. The method exists on the `CoordinatorDeps` interface but no coordinator mode ever calls `deps.spawnAndAwait()` directly; they all use the explicit `spawnSession` + `awaitSessions` + `getChildSessionResult` composition.

Removing it from `CoordinatorDepsImpl` (and optionally from the interface if the CLI doesn't need it there) would eliminate ~20 lines and make the dead path explicit.

**Done looks like:** `spawnAndAwait` removed from `CoordinatorDepsImpl`. If the interface declaration remains (for the CLI path), it can stay on `CoordinatorDeps` but with a note that the in-process implementation delegates to `spawnSession + awaitSessions + getChildSessionResult`.

### Integration test: coordinator-deps end-to-end session spawn and dispatch (May 13, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:3 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The coordinator-deps path (`startTriggerListener` → `createCoordinatorDeps(dispatch)` → `router.setCoordinatorDeps()` → `dispatchAdaptivePipeline()` → `spawnSession` → `executeStartWorkflow` + `dispatch()`) has no integration test. Every test in this chain uses either a fake `AdaptiveCoordinatorDeps` with mocked `spawnSession`, or a fake `runWorkflowFn` that never runs. The dispatch wiring, session store write, token decoding, and `router.dispatch()` → `runWorkflow` path are never exercised together.

This means a bug in the construction sequence (e.g. `setCoordinatorDeps` not called, dispatch bound to wrong router instance, session store write fails silently) would not be caught by any test -- it would only surface in a real daemon run.

The unit tests for the pieces exist: `coordinator-direct-store.test.ts` tests `SessionReader` in isolation, and `trigger-router.test.ts` tests `TriggerRouter.dispatch()` with a fake `runWorkflowFn`. What's missing is a test that wires them together with a real (or realistic in-memory) engine: start a listener, fire a trigger, assert that a session was created in the store and `runWorkflow` was called with the correct trigger.

**Done looks like:** An integration test in `tests/integration/` that:
1. Constructs a `V2ToolContext` with real in-memory stores (using `InMemorySessionEventLogStore`, `InMemorySnapshotStore`)
2. Calls `startTriggerListener` with `WORKRAIL_TRIGGERS_ENABLED=true`, a real apiKey stub, and a fake `runWorkflowFn`
3. Posts to `POST /webhook/:triggerId` via the Express app
4. Asserts that `runWorkflowFn` was called with the correct `workflowId`, `goal`, and `workspacePath`
5. Asserts that a session was created in the store (session_created event present)

**Things to hash out:**
- Should this use `InMemorySessionEventLogStore` from `tests/fakes/v2/` (already exists) or a temp-dir real store?
- The test needs a real `executeStartWorkflow` call -- does that require the full pinned workflow store, or can it use a minimal stub workflow?
- How does the test handle the async dispatch (runWorkflow runs in the background after the 202 response)?

### Keyword scan is the only active review routing path -- typed verdict is dead code (May 13, 2026)

**Status: bug** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

`parseFindingsFromNotes()` in `src/coordinators/pr-review.ts` is the ONLY active parser path for review verdicts. The code itself documents this: "the JSON block parser is aspirational -- no live workflow emits `## COORDINATOR_OUTPUT`." So whether a PR gets auto-merged, gets a fix iteration, dispatches `wr.production-readiness-audit`, or escalates to the human outbox is currently decided by regex pattern matching on the review agent's prose. The typed `wr.review_verdict` artifact path in `readVerdictArtifact()` is wired up in the coordinator but never fires in practice because `wr.mr-review` does not reliably emit that artifact.

This violates the core pipeline invariant ("typed contracts at phase boundaries, not free-text scraping") in the most consequential place: the merge/no-merge decision. A review session that writes "this is not a blocking issue" may not match the negation heuristic (`/\b(?:not|no|without)\b.{0,30}\bblocking\b/i`), triggering an audit chain on a clean PR. Unknown severity defaults to 'blocking' (conservative but incorrect routing). This is probabilistic routing pretending to be deterministic.

The lifecycle integration tests item (below) is the test-side of this: per-workflow lifecycle harness tests would catch a workflow that emits no artifact before it reaches production. But the fix is making the workflow reliably emit the artifact, not just testing that it does.

**Done looks like:** `wr.mr-review` consistently emits a `wr.review_verdict` artifact as its final step output. `readVerdictArtifact()` succeeds on real pipeline runs. `parseFindingsFromNotes()` remains as a fallback but is no longer the primary path. The coordinator's merge/no-merge decision is driven by the typed artifact.

**Leverage:** the fix also unblocks reliable `findingCategory`-based audit routing (currently the `wr.architecture-scalability-audit` vs `wr.production-readiness-audit` split can only fire when the typed artifact path succeeds).

**Partial progress (May 13, 2026):** `wr.mr-review` v2.8.0 changed `outputContract.required` from `false` to the default `true`. The engine now enforces the artifact at advance time -- the agent gets a retryable blocked response if it omits the artifact. The lifecycle test for `wr.mr-review` is shipped. What remains: confirming `readVerdictArtifact()` fires on real pipeline runs (requires an actual pipeline execution, not testable in CI). `parseFindingsFromNotes()` is still the fallback and will remain so until empirically confirmed unnecessary.

### Agent decision checkpoints: surface low-confidence architectural decisions for operator review (May 13, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Agents currently have no first-class way to flag a decision they made under uncertainty. The available tools are `report_issue` (errors), `signal_coordinator` (mid-session observations), and `complete_step` (advancement). None is designed for "I made an architectural decision I'm not fully confident in -- a human should review it before this merges." The result: agents either silently accept a questionable tradeoff (labeling it a "known limitation" in the handoff) or they block the entire session on an issue that could have been reviewed post-session. Both outcomes are wrong.

The concrete failure mode surfaced in the coordinator-deps.ts refactor (May 13, 2026): the session accepted `dispatch:null` and a `ctx.v2 ? ... : null` guard as "accepted tensions" even though both were fixable architectural problems. A decision checkpoint would have surfaced them explicitly -- "I accepted this but I'm not confident it's right" -- so a reviewer or the operator could address them before merge rather than after.

**Things to hash out:**

- **Where does flagging live?** Options: (a) a new `flag_decision` tool the agent calls explicitly; (b) the coordinator reads `keyDecisions` from the coding handoff artifact and posts low-confidence ones to the outbox; (c) `signal_coordinator` with `kind: 'approval_needed'` is already the right mechanism -- it just needs a consumption side (see `signal_coordinator has no active consumer` item). Option (c) is the least-new-surface approach.
- **What triggers flagging?** Self-assessed confidence is unreliable (agents label their most dangerous assumptions as low-severity to avoid triggering gates). A better trigger: explicit structural signals -- a decision that touches a protected file, mentions "workaround", "circular dep", "accepted tension", or "structural constraint", or adds a null check on a field that was just asserted non-nullable.
- **What is the response path?** Without `worktrain inbox` or a console UI, flagging decisions is noise. This item is blocked on the consumption side of `signal_coordinator` / outbox ack.
- **Is this session-level or PR-level?** The agent could flag during the session (before the PR is created), or the coordinator could surface decisions for operator review between coding and review phases. PR-level is cleaner -- the reviewer agent could be given the flagged decisions as part of its context.
- **Relationship to interpretation checkpoint**: the interpretation checkpoint (PR #962) catches ambiguous task understanding before coding starts. This item catches ambiguous architectural choices made during coding. Different problem, different hook point.

**Blocked by:** `signal_coordinator` has no active consumer (outbox ack not yet implemented). Flag this as a dependency if building the `signal_coordinator` path.

### `signal_coordinator` has no active consumer (May 13, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 6** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

`signal_coordinator` writes structured signals to `~/.workrail/signals/<sessionId>.jsonl` and the daemon event stream. The tool is exposed to agents and documented in the system prompt. But no coordinator currently reads those signals during execution -- the sidecar files are written and never consumed. The signals are purely observational: visible in the console's event stream, but not acted on by any coordinator logic.

Similarly, `pollOutboxAck()` (used by the UX gate in FULL pipeline for large-complexity UI tasks) polls a JSONL cursor for a human acknowledgment. But there is no `worktrain inbox` command or UI for the operator to actually respond to an outbox entry. Without it, the UX gate either waits 24 hours and escalates, or is a dead code path.

Neither is a correctness bug -- skipping signals is silent, the UX gate escalates cleanly on timeout. But both represent infrastructure built without the consumption side, so the features they enable (mid-session coordinator reaction, human-in-the-loop approvals) are not actually available.

**Done looks like (signal_coordinator):** at least one coordinator reads signal sidecar files -- either polling during `awaitSessions()` or post-session -- and routes based on signal kind (e.g. `approval_needed` pauses the pipeline, `blocked` triggers early escalation).

**Done looks like (outbox ack):** `worktrain inbox` command that lists unacknowledged outbox entries and lets the operator respond. Response is written back in a format `pollOutboxAck()` can detect.

**Things to hash out:**
- Is the right consumption model polling (coordinator checks the sidecar file periodically) or push (agent emits signal, coordinator callback fires mid-await)?
- For the outbox ack: is a CLI command the right interface, or should the console web UI surface this?

Today the pipeline creates a `branchStrategy: 'worktree'` for the coding session only. Discovery writes a design doc to the main workspace. Shaping reads it and writes a pitch. Coding forks from `main` into an isolated worktree -- but if that worktree was created from `main` before discovery's design doc or shaping's pitch were committed, the coding agent cannot see them. The pipeline's file handoffs are silently broken the moment any phase writes to disk rather than committing.

**Shipped in PR #1005.** Coordinator creates one worktree (`worktrain/<runId>`) before the first session spawns. All phases use it as `workspacePath`. Branch name is coordinator-determined -- `CodingHandoffArtifactV1.branchName` is now optional (used for audit only). Enricher correctly resolves git-common-dir so all worktree sessions find prior session context. `setupPipelineWorktree()` in `coordinator-worktree.ts` handles crash recovery, creation, and context persistence for both FULL and IMPLEMENT modes.

Two new assessments: `type-design-gate` (nullable fields encoding distinct states must use explicit variants) and `interface-responsibility-gate` (one-sentence responsibility check before extending any interface). `phase-0-6-design-constraints` now has three independently-scoped consequences -- one targeted remediation per gate. `phase-1b-design-deep` converted from `templateCall` to inline `promptBlocks` to explicitly thread `derivedConstraints` into candidate generation. This required also shipping multiple assessment consequences per step (see next item).

### Reliable synthetic human gates: mimicking operator approval and refusal in autonomous pipelines (May 6, 2026)

**Status: partially shipped** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Shipped (PRs #1009, #1011, #1013, #1015, #1018, May 14-15, 2026):** The gate system is functional end-to-end. Daemon sessions park at `requireConfirmation` steps, the coordinator evaluates with `wr.gate-eval-generic` v1.2.0 using the parked step's actual notes and artifacts, and resumes with the verdict injected into the step prompt. Uncertain verdicts are escalated to the operator outbox. 7 bugs found in post-merge review were fixed in PR #1018 (gate never fired, resumeFromGate always failed, dispatch() orphaned sessions, branchStrategy lost on resume, dedupeKey collisions, delimiter validation, consequence drop on validation error). **What remains:** typed criteria per gate use-case (not just general quality standards), cross-family challenger (different model family), calibration dataset for verdict accuracy, integration test for the full gate path, `stepArtifacts` size cap.

WorkTrain's pipeline has several points where a human operator would naturally approve, reject, or redirect -- confirming an interpretation before coding starts, approving a direction from discovery, accepting a shaped pitch. In guided MCP sessions these gates fire as `requireConfirmation` steps. In fully autonomous daemon sessions, they either don't fire or surface to the operator outbox and wait indefinitely. There is currently no reliable mechanism for the coordinator to make these gate decisions autonomously in a way that is trustworthy enough to substitute for human judgment.

The problem is not just "add an LLM to make the decision." An LLM making approval decisions is subject to the same sycophancy, self-enhancement bias, and overconfidence problems the rest of the pipeline has. A naïve "spawn an agent to approve this" produces rubber-stamping, not genuine gatekeeping. What is needed is a structured, auditable, multi-signal gate that approximates what a careful human reviewer would do -- checking specific criteria, flagging specific concerns, requiring specific evidence before proceeding.

**What a strong synthetic gate needs:**
- Typed criteria against which the artifact is evaluated (not free-form "does this look good?")
- An independent agent that did not produce the artifact being evaluated
- A cross-family challenger where possible (different model family = different correlated blind spots)
- A structured verdict with explicit rationale tied to the criteria, not a confidence score
- An escalation path when the synthetic gate is uncertain -- surface to operator rather than rubber-stamp

**Use cases that need this:**
- Interpretation checkpoint: does the coded assumption set actually cover the architectural risks for this ticket?
- Shaping approval: does the pitch have genuine acceptance criteria or are they vague enough to accept anything?
- Discovery direction: is the selected direction actually distinct from the runner-up, or are they the same approach with different labels?
- Review verdict: is this finding severe enough to block merge, or is it a style preference being inflated?

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the right abstraction? A reusable `synthetic-gate` routine that takes typed criteria + artifact and returns a structured verdict? Or specialized gates per use case?
- How do you prevent the synthetic gate from being gamed by the same agent that produced the artifact? The gate agent must not have access to the producing agent's reasoning, only its output.
- What is the confidence threshold below which the synthetic gate escalates to a human rather than deciding? And how is that threshold configured per trigger?
- How do you validate that a synthetic gate is actually performing the function of a human gate -- not just producing confident verdicts? Requires a calibration dataset of known-correct and known-incorrect artifacts with human ground truth.
- Relationship to the `requireConfirmation` gate mechanism: the synthetic gate is the autonomous equivalent. It should produce the same typed routing signal the human confirmation gate produces, so the coordinator routing logic doesn't need to know which kind of gate fired.

**Next concrete step:** Author typed per-use-case evaluation criteria in `wr.gate-eval-generic` (or specialized evaluator workflows per gate type). The current generic evaluator applies general quality standards -- meaningful gates need criteria specific to what each gate is guarding.

`src/mcp/handlers/v2-advance-core/index.ts:313` detects daemon sessions via `v.mergedContext['is_autonomous'] === 'true'` -- a magic string check in an unconstrained `Record<string, unknown>` map. The daemon writes this key at session start (`pre-agent-session.ts:102`).

The check is correct and necessary (using the autonomy preference was previously wrong -- all sessions start with 'guided'), but it violates "validate at boundaries, trust inside" by checking an untyped context key deep in the advance path. The better design is a typed first-class concept that the advance handler can rely on without magic string matching.

**Options:** (a) Add a session-level `daemonMode: boolean` field to the session event schema, written at start time via a dedicated `preferences_changed` event or `session_meta` event; (b) Promote `is_autonomous` to a typed context slot with a registered key constant. Option (a) is cleaner architecturally but is a schema change. Option (b) is lower blast radius. Neither is urgent -- the current behavior is correct.

### Agents must not perform delivery actions -- only the coordinator's delivery layer can (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

Daemon agents currently have unrestricted access to `gh` and `git` via the `Bash` tool. There is nothing preventing an agent from running `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge --squash --auto`, `git push --force`, or any other delivery action inside its session. These actions should be exclusively the coordinator delivery layer's responsibility -- they happen after the session completes, after all quality gates pass, through explicit coordinator scripts. Agents that perform them autonomously bypass every gate that was designed to protect the pipeline.

The problem is architectural: delivery actions are not separated from agent capabilities. An agent that calls `gh pr merge` mid-session has merged before the coordinator's review routing, before CI has a chance to run, before any post-session quality check fires. This is not a hypothetical -- a sufficiently "helpful" agent will try to complete the job it was given, which includes delivery.

The correct invariant: delivery actions (open PR, merge PR, enable auto-merge, push to main, post to external systems) are only reachable through the coordinator's `autoCommit`, `autoOpenPR`, and delivery pipeline scripts -- not through the agent's Bash tool. The agent's job ends when it calls `complete_step` on the final step. Everything after that is coordinator-owned.

**Things to hash out:**
- How is "delivery action" defined precisely enough to enforce? `gh pr create` is delivery; `gh pr view` is read-only. `git push origin feature-branch` is delivery; `git status` is not. The boundary is write-to-external-system.
- Can this be enforced at the tool level (block specific shell commands in the Bash tool) or does it require a capability-based architecture (agents get a restricted Bash that can't reach delivery commands)?
- The `daemon-soul.md` could document this as a rule, but that relies on LLM compliance -- not enforcement. What is the structural mechanism?
- How does this interact with workflows that intentionally ask the agent to run delivery scripts (e.g. a workflow step that says "commit your changes")? Those may be legitimate. The distinction is agent-initiated delivery vs coordinator-authorized delivery.
- Should the coordinator pass a `deliveryAllowed: false` flag that the daemon enforces in the Bash tool wrapper? Or is this a workflow authoring constraint?

### Event-driven agent coordination (coordinator as event bus)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 11** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Problem:** Agents managing an MR should not poll for review comments or CI status -- that wastes turns and burns tokens. Instead, the coordinator should register for events and steer the agent when something relevant happens.

The infrastructure already exists: `steerRegistry` + `POST /sessions/:id/steer`, `signal_coordinator` tool, `DaemonEventEmitter`.

**What's missing:** Coordinator-side event sources (GitHub webhooks or polling fallback) and an event-to-steer bridge that maps `MREvent` to structured steer messages.

**How it works:** MR management agent session is parked (no pending turns). Coordinator registers for GitHub events. When review comment/CI failure/approval arrives, coordinator steers the running session. Agent responds. No polling from the agent side.

**Agent session prompt:** "Do not poll for PR status. Wait for the coordinator to deliver events via injected messages."

**Things to hash out:**
- How does the coordinator distinguish between a GitHub webhook event and a polling fallback event when both are in flight? Is deduplication needed?
- What is the protocol for a parked agent session -- does it consume a slot in `maxConcurrentSessions` while parked, or is the slot released and re-acquired when an event arrives?
- How long can an agent session remain parked before the coordinator gives up and closes it? Is there a configurable TTL for event-waiting?
- Should the coordinator register for GitHub events directly, or should a shared event router handle all webhook subscriptions and fan out to interested coordinators?
- If the steer injection fails (session has timed out or been garbage collected), what does the coordinator do with the pending event?

4. Approval tracking -- when all gates pass, trigger merge
5. Merge conflict resolution -- rebase or escalate complex conflicts

- CI pipeline monitoring requires parsing CI failure logs, which are provider-specific (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc.). Is the lifecycle manager expected to handle multiple providers, or is it scoped to one initially?
- "Retry flaky tests" is a significant decision with potential to exhaust CI minutes. What is the policy for how many retries are allowed, and who decides when a test is "flaky" vs genuinely broken?
- For merge conflict resolution, what is the boundary between "safe to rebase automatically" and "requires human escalation"? Is this a heuristic, a file-set check, or something else?
- What happens if the lifecycle manager itself fails mid-run (daemon crash, token expiry)? Is the MR left in a consistent state, or can it be in a partially processed state?
- Who is responsible for the MR while the lifecycle manager is active -- WorkTrain or the human who opened the task? Can the human intervene and override without confusing the manager?
- How does the lifecycle manager handle PRs that become stale while waiting for CI (main advances, merge conflict develops)?

### Phase-scoped context files

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

**Design:** Teams define context files scoped to specific pipeline phases under `.worktrain/rules/`:
- `discovery.md`, `shaping.md`, `implementation.md`, `review.md`, `delivery.md`, `pr-management.md`, `all.md`

Each file is injected only into sessions running the matching pipeline phase. Reduces token waste and rule dilution. `all.md` is equivalent to today's AGENTS.md injection.

**Load order (most specific wins):** `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` (base) → `.worktrain/rules/all.md` → phase-specific file.

### Coordinator architecture: separation of concerns

**Status: done** | Shipped May 2026 (PRs #947, #954)

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The layering is implemented:
```
Trigger layer         src/trigger/          receives events, validates, enqueues
Dispatch layer        adaptive-pipeline.ts  decides workflow + goal (queue-polled tasks)
Context assembly      src/daemon/           WorkflowEnricher enriches before runWorkflow()
Orchestration layer   src/coordinators/     CoordinatorSpawnContext typed interface (PR #954)
Delivery layer        src/trigger/delivery  posts results back to origin systems
```

Universal enricher provides the floor (prior workspace notes + git diff for all entry points). Coordinators provide the ceiling (phase artifacts, PR-specific context via `assembledContextSummary`). Enricher suppresses prior-notes when `assembledContextSummary` is already set -- resolved, not additive.

### Scheduled tasks (native cron provider)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 11** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

**Gap:** No native cron/schedule provider. Workaround is OS crontab calling `curl`.

**Design:**
```yaml
triggers:
  - id: weekly-code-health
    provider: schedule
    cron: "0 9 * * 1"
    workflowId: architecture-scalability-audit
    workspacePath: /path/to/repo
    goal: "Run weekly code health scan"
```

**Key decisions:**
- Standard 5-field cron syntax, configurable timezone
- Missed runs NOT caught up by default (optional `catchUp: true`)
- Overlap prevention: if a run is still active when the next tick fires, skip it
- `worktrain run schedule <trigger-id>` for manual trigger

**Implementation:** `PollingScheduler` already runs time-based loops. Schedule provider would use cron expression matching instead of API polling. State persists to `~/.workrail/schedule-state.json`.

**Things to hash out:**
- `schedule-state.json` records last-run timestamps. If the daemon is not running at the scheduled time, what happens when it next starts -- does the missed run execute immediately, wait for the next tick, or follow the `catchUp: true` policy?
- Timezone support requires knowing the user's local timezone at schedule-definition time, not at execution time. What happens when the operator moves to a different timezone?
- "Overlap prevention" skips a tick if a run is still active. What is the notification when a run is skipped? Does the operator know they missed a scheduled execution?
- Should `worktrain run schedule <trigger-id>` bypass the overlap check (for manual debugging), or respect it?
- How does the schedule provider interact with the daemon's `maxConcurrentSessions` limit? A scheduled job at full capacity could be silently dropped without an overlap check.

### Autonomous grooming loop + workOnAll mode

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs scheduled tasks)

**Three autonomy levels:**

- **Level 0 (current):** Human applies `worktrain` label to specific issues. WorkTrain works those only.
- **Level 1 -- workOnAll:** Config flag `workOnAll: true`. WorkTrain looks at ALL open issues, infers which are actionable, picks highest-priority. Escape hatch: `worktrain:skip` label.
- **Level 2 -- Fully proactive:** WorkTrain also surfaces work it found itself (failing CI, backlog items with no issue, patterns in git history).

**Grooming loop (scheduled nightly):** Reads backlog, open issues, recent completed work. Closes resolved issues. For ungroomed items: infers maturity (linked spec, acceptance criteria, vague language). For high-value idea-level items: runs `wr.discovery` + `wr.shaping`, creates/updates issue.

**workOnAll config:**
```json
{ "workOnAll": true, "workOnAllExclusions": ["needs-design", "blocked-external"], "maxConcurrentSelf": 2 }
```

**Things to hash out:**
- The grooming loop reads and writes GitHub issues autonomously. What safeguards prevent it from closing issues that are still relevant but appear resolved?
- What is the "infer which issues are actionable" heuristic? Misclassification could cause WorkTrain to skip important work or start unwanted sessions.
- `workOnAll: true` effectively gives WorkTrain permission to work on any open issue. How does the operator set scope limits beyond label exclusions -- e.g. restrict to a specific project, milestone, or assignee?
- How does WorkTrain avoid duplicate work when `workOnAll` is enabled and another human or agent is already working on the same issue?
- What is the escalation path when a grooomed issue turns out to need human judgment? Does WorkTrain leave a comment and move on, or does it hold the item?
- Should `maxConcurrentSelf` apply at the daemon level or the workspace level? A single daemon managing multiple repos needs per-workspace caps.

### Escalating review gates based on finding severity

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Problem:** "Blocking" is binary -- a single Critical finding and a trivially incorrect comment are treated identically.

**Right behavior:** After a fix round, if re-review still returns Critical:
1. Another full MR review -- confirm the Critical is real, not a false positive
2. Production readiness audit -- a Critical finding often implies a runtime risk
3. Architecture audit -- if the Critical is architectural

Routing by `finding.category` from `wr.review_verdict`:
- `correctness` / `security` -> always trigger prod audit
- `architecture` / `design` -> trigger arch audit
- All -> trigger re-review

**Hard rule:** A PR that triggered the escalating audit chain should NEVER auto-merge. Human explicit approval required.

**Things to hash out:**
- The escalation routing by `finding.category` assumes categories are reliably assigned by the review workflow. How accurate is that classification in practice? A misclassified category could skip the wrong audit type.
- How are false positives handled in the escalating chain? If a production audit is triggered by a Critical finding that turns out to be incorrect, is there a path to clear it without human intervention?
- The "hard rule: never auto-merge after escalation" is correct but creates a potential pile-up of PRs waiting for human approval. Is there a notification mechanism to surface these to the operator?
- Should the escalation chain be configurable per workspace or per workflow, or is it a global policy?
- How does this interact with `riskLevel=Critical` tasks that already require human approval by policy? Are the two gates additive or redundant?

### Workflow execution time tracking and prediction

**Status: partial** | Tracking shipped; prediction/calibration layer not yet built

**Score: 11** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:3 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

**Problem:** Timeouts are set by intuition. No data on how long workflows actually take.

**What to track:** For every completed session -- workflow ID, total wall-clock duration, turn count, step advances, outcome, task complexity signals. Store in `~/.workrail/data/execution-stats.jsonl`.

**Uses:**
- Calibrate timeouts automatically (p95 * 1.5)
- Predict duration before dispatch
- Step-advance rate as workflow efficiency proxy

**Implementation:** Append to `execution-stats.jsonl` in `runWorkflow()`'s finally block.

**Things to hash out:**
- How many data points are needed before timeout calibration is reliable? p95 * 1.5 from 3 samples is very different from p95 from 300 samples.
- Should auto-calibrated timeouts update `triggers.yml` in place, or only influence the daemon's internal behavior? Modifying `triggers.yml` autonomously is a significant action.
- Duration data varies by model, task complexity, and LLM provider load. Should the prediction account for these dimensions, or just average across them?
- What happens to prediction accuracy when workflow structure changes significantly between versions? Should stats from old workflow versions be excluded?
- Who can see and act on the execution stats? Should they be surfaced in the console or only in raw `.jsonl` form?

**Fix -- two layers:**

1. **Startup auto-cleanup (light):** On MCP server startup, silently remove managed sources where the filesystem path doesn't exist. Log "removed N stale sources."

2. **`workrail cleanup` command:**
   ```
   workrail cleanup [--yes] [--sessions --older-than <age>] [--sources] [--cache] [--roots]
   ```

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the policy for session retention -- is 500 sessions a problem in practice, or does it only become one after thousands? What storage cost is acceptable?
- Startup auto-cleanup silently removes managed sources for non-existent paths. If a path is temporarily unmounted (NAS, external drive), silent removal is destructive. Should there be a warning or confirmation before removing?
- `workrail cleanup --sessions --older-than <age>` deletes event logs. For debugging past failures, old session logs are valuable. Is there a distinction between sessions worth keeping and sessions safe to delete?
- Should cleanup be idempotent and safe to run while the MCP server is live, or does it require the server to be stopped?
- Who decides the default `--older-than` threshold? Too aggressive loses useful history; too conservative lets the store grow unbounded.

### Subagent context packaging

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Problem:** When a main agent spawns a subagent, the work package is too thin. The main agent has rich context (why this approach was chosen, what was tried, what constraints were discovered) but packages the subagent task as a one-liner.

**Design (Option B -- structured work package):**
```typescript
spawnSession({
  workflowId: 'coding-task-workflow-agentic',
  goal: '...',
  context: {
    whyThisApproach: '...',
    alreadyTried: [...],
    knownConstraints: [...],
    relevantFiles: [...],
    completionCriteria: '...'
  }
})
```

**Context mode:** `context: 'inherit' | 'blank' | 'custom'`. Blank is for adversarial roles (challenger, reviewer) where anchoring to main-agent context is counterproductive.

**Session knowledge log:** As the main agent progresses, it appends to `session-knowledge.jsonl` -- decisions, user pushback, relevant files, constraints, things tried and failed. Auto-included in subagent work packages.

**Things to hash out:**
- Who enforces the `context` mode? If the spawning agent passes `context: 'inherit'` for an adversarial reviewer, the reviewer's independence is compromised. Is enforcement engine-level or convention?
- How large can the structured context bundle grow before it becomes a liability rather than an asset? Is there a hard token budget for `whyThisApproach`, `alreadyTried`, etc.?
- The `session-knowledge.jsonl` is append-only. Over a long session it could grow to thousands of entries. What is the selection/truncation strategy when packaging it into a subagent bundle?
- How does the main agent know when to append to `session-knowledge.jsonl`? Is this tool-driven (explicit call), automatic on step advance, or heuristic?
- What is the format and schema for `completionCriteria`? A natural language string is hard to evaluate programmatically -- is structured output needed?

### Workflow-scoped system prompts for subagents

  "steps": [...]
}
```

Step-level `systemPrompt` overrides workflow-level for that step.

**Composition layers:**
1. WorkTrain base prompt
2. Workflow-level `systemPrompt`
3. Step-level `systemPrompt`
4. Soul file (operator behavioral rules)
5. AGENTS.md / workspace context
6. Session knowledge log (if `context: 'inherit'`)
7. Step prompt

**Things to hash out:**
- The composition order lists 7 layers. At what point does total system prompt size become a context window concern for the model? Is there a budget or truncation policy?
- Should workflow authors be able to completely replace the WorkTrain base prompt, or only add to it? A workflow that removes the base prompt's safety constraints is a significant risk vector.
- Step-level overrides apply only to that step, but the model's behavior may be shaped for the entire session by earlier steps. Is there a "reset" mechanism for step-scoped prompts?
- If the same content appears in both the workflow-level `systemPrompt` and AGENTS.md, is that redundancy acceptable or should there be a deduplication step?
- How is a workflow-scoped `systemPrompt` authored and validated? Is it freeform text, or are there constraints on what it can contain?

### `context-gather` step type

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Problem:** Phase 0.5 in the coding workflow currently looks for a shaped pitch by checking a local path. This doesn't handle coordinator-injected context, manually written docs (GDoc, Confluence, Notion), Glean-indexed artifacts, or URLs embedded in the task description. The search logic is duplicated if other workflows need the same document.

**Proposed primitive:**
```json
{
  "type": "context-gather",
  "id": "gather-pitch",
  "contextType": "shaped-pitch",
  "outputVar": "shapedInput",
  "optional": true,
  "sources": ["coordinator-injected", "local-paths", "task-url", "glean"]
}
```

**Source resolution order (stops at first hit):**
1. `coordinator-injected` -- coordinator already attached context of this type
2. `local-paths` -- check `.workrail/current-pitch.md`, `pitch.md`, `.workrail/pitches/`
3. `task-url` -- extract any URL from task description and fetch
4. `glean` -- search Glean for recent docs matching task keywords (opt-in only)

**Why engine-level:** Coordinator intercept requires the engine to check "has this type already been provided?" before running any search. A routine can't express that.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the contract between a `context-gather` step and the workflow steps that consume `outputVar`? If the step is `optional: true` and returns nothing, downstream steps that reference `shapedInput` get an empty value -- is that safe?
- The `task-url` source extracts URLs from the task description and fetches them. This is a network call at engine level. Who is responsible for auth, rate limiting, and error handling for remote fetches?
- The `glean` source is opt-in only. What is the opt-in mechanism -- a daemon config flag, a workflow declaration, or a user preference?
- How does the engine signal to the agent that context was gathered successfully vs not found? Is this visible in the step prompt, or does the agent need to check `outputVar` itself?
- Can a `context-gather` step block session start if a required source is unavailable, or should it always succeed (possibly with an empty result)?

### Parallel spawn_agent: run multiple subagents simultaneously instead of sequentially (May 11, 2026)

**Status: done** | Shipped PR #994 (May 11, 2026)

**Score: 14** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:3 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

`spawn_agent` currently blocks the parent turn until the child session completes. When a workflow spawns multiple agents (e.g. wr.discovery phase-3b spawns 2-3 executor sessions for candidate generation), they run sequentially -- each ~20 minutes back-to-back. Total wall clock: 40-60 minutes of a 55-minute budget, leaving nothing for the remaining phases. The workflow is designed to run them simultaneously ("spawn SIMULTANEOUSLY" in the step instructions) but the tool doesn't support it.

Extending `spawn_agent` to accept an array of sessions and internally `Promise.all` over them would cut 40-60 minutes of sequential delegation down to ~20 minutes (max of parallel). With a 55-minute discovery budget, the full pipeline would complete comfortably. This is a contained change: the agent's contract stays the same (call it, wait for all, get all results), the tool factories change internally, the workflow steps don't need rewriting.

**This is the primary near-term fix for the wr.discovery timeout problem.** The 30-minute daemon default (filed separately as critical) should be fixed in parallel.

**Things to hash out:**
- API design: array overload on `spawn_agent` vs separate `spawn_agents_parallel` tool? Array is simpler for the agent; separate tool is more explicit.
- Error semantics: if one child fails, do we return partial results or fail the whole call? Likely partial results with per-child outcome.
- Order of results: does the result array match the input order or completion order? Input order is safer for the agent.
- How does the agent express per-child goals when using parallel spawn? Each array element needs its own goal string and workflowId.

### Coordinator-managed fan-out with workflow-declared context injection (May 11, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 11** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The full pipeline coordinator currently delegates all session spawning logic to the main agent. For workflows that do fan-out (spawn N subagents with different focus angles), the main agent constructs each agent's goal string inline, embedding synthesized context from earlier phases. This is correct when the goal strings require synthesized understanding only the main agent has. But it's unnecessary coordination overhead when the goal strings could be derived from the workflow definition plus prior phase artifacts.

The vision: a workflow step declares `fanOut: { count: N, routineId: 'wr.routine-tension-driven-design', contextSlots: [...] }`. The coordinator reads the workflow declaration, injects the requested artifacts from prior phase outputs (e.g. `decisionCriteria`, `riskiestAssumption`, `idealEndState` from discovery phase-2), and spawns the N agents directly -- without the main agent writing individual goal strings. The main agent stays involved only for synthesis after the fan-out completes.

This requires two things: (1) workflows to be more verbose about what context each subagent needs (not just "spawn 2-3 executors" as free text), and (2) the coordinator to understand how to resolve context references from prior phase artifacts. The workflow declaration would also specify what context from previous workflows to include/omit, giving the operator control over context injection granularity.

**This is the longer-term correct architecture for coordinator-managed orchestration.** Parallel `spawn_agent` (above) is the near-term fix; this is what makes the coordinator fully autonomous at orchestration.

**Things to hash out:**
- Context injection spec: how does the workflow declare which prior-phase artifacts to pass to each subagent? A `contextSlots` array with dot-path references to session context variables? A typed `ContextBundle` declaration per fan-out arm?
- When does the coordinator generate goal strings vs. the main agent? The key question: can the coordinator generate goal strings that are "good enough" without the main agent's synthesized priors, given access to the prior phase artifacts? This depends heavily on the workflow. For review/challenge workflows (give each agent a different adversarial angle), the coordinator can probably handle it. For synthesis-dependent workflows (each agent's angle must be grounded in what the main agent learned), the main agent still needs to write the brief.
- Cross-workflow context: sometimes the context needed for a fan-out arm comes from a previous pipeline phase (e.g. discovery → shaping → coding). The coordinator would need a structured way to pass phase artifacts across session boundaries. This is related to the PipelineRunContext work already in the coordinator.
- How verbose is too verbose? If every fan-out step requires a detailed workflow declaration, workflow authoring becomes significantly more complex. The right balance may be: simple fan-outs (identical routine, different angles) use coordinator-managed injection; complex fan-outs (bespoke per-arm instructions) keep the main agent in the loop.

### Async spawn_agent: non-blocking delegation for long-running subagents (May 11, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

`spawn_agent` blocks the parent session until the child completes. For short child sessions (seconds to a few minutes) this is fine. For long child sessions (10-20+ minutes), the parent's budget is consumed waiting. An async variant -- `spawn_agent` returns a handle immediately, the parent continues working and polls or is notified when the child completes -- would allow the parent to do other work in parallel.

This is a more significant change than parallel `spawn_agent` (above) because it changes the agent's programming model: the agent must now write logic to check handles and wait for results, rather than calling the tool and reading the result inline. Workflows that use `spawn_agent` today assume blocking semantics; they would need to be rewritten to use the async variant.

This is the right long-term direction for truly concurrent multi-agent workflows. But parallel `spawn_agent` (run N blocking children simultaneously) solves the immediate wr.discovery bottleneck without changing the agent's programming model, so async `spawn_agent` is not needed urgently.

**Things to hash out:**
- What does the agent do while waiting? It could do other workflow steps that don't depend on the child's output. But most fan-out patterns require all children to complete before synthesis can start -- so the "do other work" window may be small in practice.
- Handle API: `spawn_agent_async` returns a `{ handle }`. The agent calls `await_agent(handle)` or `check_agent(handle)`. What does `check_agent` return for a still-running child? A progress signal? The steer mechanism already exists for pushing updates to running sessions.
- Cooperative completion interaction: once cooperative completion is implemented (see session-budget-cooperative-completion.md), an async child that pauses creates a parent that is waiting on a handle that never resolves. How does this compose?

**Status: designing** | Priority: medium

**Score: 7** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:1 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Simplify third-party and team workflow hookup by requiring explicit `workspacePath`, silently remembering repo roots in user-level `~/.workrail/config.json`, recursively discovering team/module `.workrail/workflows/` folders under remembered roots, and improving grouped source visibility / precedence explanations.

**Current recommendation:**
- Phase 1: Rooted Team Sharing + minimal Source Control Tower
- Require explicit workspace identity
- Silently persist repo roots at the user level
- Support cross-repo workflows from remembered roots
- Make remote repos default to managed-sync mode rather than pinned snapshots or live-remote behavior
- Treat Slack/chat/file/zip sharing as an ingestion path that classifies into repo, file, pack, or snippet flows
- Design the backend so the console can eventually manage and explain the remembered/discovered source model

**Additional idea:** explore enterprise auth / SSO integration for private repo access, such as Okta-backed flows for GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, or other self-hosted providers. Main question: should WorkRail integrate directly with identity providers like Okta, or should it integrate one layer lower with Git hosts / credential helpers that are already SSO-aware?

### Actionable blocked responses: tell the agent exactly what to fix, not just that it failed (May 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

When the engine blocks an advance (output contract not satisfied, validation criteria failed, required field missing), the agent receives a generic error message. It knows something is wrong but not what specifically needs to change. The result is wasted turns where the agent retries with variations that still fail, or gives up and produces a different kind of wrong output.

Every blocked response should be actionable: tell the agent the exact schema expected, what was provided, and the precise call needed to fix it.

**Examples of current vs. better:**

Output contract failure:
- Current: `"output contract not satisfied: wr.review_verdict required"`
- Better: `"Phase 6 requires a wr.review_verdict artifact in complete_step's artifacts[] parameter. Your last call provided 0 artifacts. Required schema: { kind: 'wr.review_verdict', verdict: 'clean'|'minor'|'blocking', confidence: 'high'|'medium'|'low', findings: [...], summary: '...' }. Call complete_step again with this artifact."`

Validation criteria failure:
- Current: `"validation criterion not met"`
- Better: `"Criterion: 'build must pass'. Evidence required: Bash output showing 0 TypeScript errors. Provide this evidence in your notes before advancing."`

Required field missing:
- Current: `"missing required field"`
- Better: `"The wr.review_verdict artifact is missing required field 'findings'. Include an empty array if there are no findings: findings: []"`

**Implementation:** the blocked response is built in `src/mcp/handlers/v2-advance-core/outcome-blocked.ts`. It currently surfaces validation results as-is. Enriching it with schema context (from the outputContract's contractRef, resolved against the artifact schemas) and diff context (what was provided vs. what was required) is the targeted change.

**Things to hash out:**
- How much schema detail is useful vs. noisy? A full JSON schema dump of `wr.review_verdict` is too long. The agent needs the minimum to fix the call -- field names, types, and a concrete example.
- Should the blocked message include the agent's previous call so it can see the diff? "You called complete_step with artifacts: [] -- add the wr.review_verdict object."

### Full session lifecycle management: real status, cleanup, and operator control (May 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 15** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:3 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain has all the data needed to know exactly what every session is doing at any moment -- it just doesn't surface it. The session event log has precise state: which step is active, how many LLM turns have been taken, whether a Bedrock call is in flight, whether the agent is waiting on a spawn_agent child, whether a gate is parked. Instead of inferring "probably stuck" from "no step advance in 60 minutes", the operator should be able to see exactly what's happening and act on it.

**What this covers:**

**Precise session status** (not guesses):
- `running:turn_N` -- agent loop active, turn N of current step, last LLM call started X seconds ago
- `running:awaiting_child` -- spawn_agent in flight, waiting on N child sessions
- `running:bedrock_call` -- Bedrock API call in progress, started X seconds ago (visible when call is hung)
- `gate_parked:human_approval` -- parked at human_approval gate, draft review created, waiting for publish
- `gate_parked:coordinator_eval` -- parked at coordinator gate, evaluator session running
- `completed:success` / `completed:error` / `completed:stuck` / `completed:timeout` -- terminal states with full detail
- `orphaned` -- process died, token still valid, eligible for resume

**Session management actions** (from console or CLI):
- `worktrain session kill <id>` -- abort the agent loop cleanly, write a terminal event, clean up sidecar and worktree
- `worktrain session archive <id>` -- mark completed sessions as archived so they don't clutter the console
- `worktrain session resume <id>` -- manually trigger recovery for an orphaned session
- `worktrain session retry <id>` -- re-fire the workflow from the beginning with the same goal and trigger context (useful when a session died on a transient error)
- Bulk cleanup: archive all sessions older than N days, kill all stuck sessions, etc.

**Console improvements:**
- Status badges on every session in the list: not just "active/complete" but the precise state above
- Real-time status updates for active sessions without requiring a page refresh
- Filter by status: show only running, only stuck, only gate-parked, only errored
- Session detail shows the current LLM turn count, wall-clock time per step, which child sessions are running
- "Kill" and "Archive" buttons on each session card

**The data exists.** `DaemonEventEmitter` fires `tool_called`, `step_advanced`, `session_completed` on every event. The `ActivityRegistry` (or equivalent) tracks which sessions are in the active set. The session sidecar has `workflowId`, `goal`, `worktreePath`. The gap is plumbing this into the console's session list projection and adding the management endpoints.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the right source for real-time "is this session currently making a Bedrock call" -- the `onLlmTurnStarted` callback in `AgentLoop` fires before each call, but the console reads from the session store. Bridging the two requires either a separate in-process state map or a new "heartbeat" event kind written to the session log on each LLM call start.
- Session cleanup for worktrees: killing a session that used `branchStrategy: 'worktree'` or `read-only` needs to clean up the worktree on disk -- the kill action should trigger `git worktree remove`.
- Archive vs delete: archived sessions should be queryable (for audit, for learning from edits) but not shown by default. Delete should require explicit confirmation.

When the daemon crashes or a session is killed (network hang, OOM, SIGTERM, machine sleep), sessions with meaningful progress should resume automatically and transparently on the next daemon start. No data loss, no need for the operator to intervene, no re-firing webhooks.

The current state: crash recovery exists and works for some failure modes (clean process crash with a valid sidecar). It fails for hung-call kills because the sidecar's `continueToken` may not reflect the latest state if the process died mid-Bedrock-call before the token was updated. The operator currently has to notice the session died, figure out why, and re-fire manually.

**What "perfect" looks like:**
- Daemon starts → silently scans for orphaned sessions → resumes each one with 0 operator input
- Operator sees the session in the console continuing from where it left off, not restarted from scratch
- No ceremony: the session store is the source of truth, the sidecar is just the handshake token. As long as the token is valid, the agent loop restarts directly from the current step.
- Failed resume (expired token, corrupted sidecar) surfaces a clear notification: "Session X could not be resumed -- re-fire required" rather than silently discarding
- Metrics: track resume success rate; a high discard rate means the sidecar write is not durable enough

**Key gaps to close:**
1. **Sidecar durability during hung calls**: the `continueToken` sidecar should be written atomically on every step advance AND on every token update (already done), but the "last written before the hang" case needs to be validated at recovery time -- the token must still be valid in the store, not just present on disk
2. **Per-call timeout** (see adjacent backlog entry): prevents the hung-call case entirely by aborting stalled Bedrock requests before they require a process kill
3. **Resume notification**: when a session is resumed at startup, emit a macOS notification and log entry so the operator knows it happened
4. **Clear failure message**: when a session cannot be resumed (token expired, store inconsistency), write to outbox with session ID, workflow, goal, and the reason -- enough for the operator to re-fire with context

### Stall timer must apply to in-flight Bedrock calls, not just inter-call gaps (May 15, 2026)

**Status: done** | Shipped fix/etienneb/per-call-llm-timeout (May 2026)

**Score: 14** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:3 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The current stall detection in `AgentLoop` (`stallTimeoutMs`) fires when no new LLM API call has *started* within the configured window. It resets each time `client.messages.create()` is about to be called. But if a Bedrock call *starts* and then hangs indefinitely (the HTTP request is in flight but never returns -- network issue, Bedrock internal error, throttle without a response), the stall timer never fires because the next call never starts. The session holds its queue slot until `maxSessionMinutes` expires.

This is the actual cause of sessions sitting silent for 10+ minutes: the hung Bedrock call is not covered by the stall timer's guard.

**The fix:** the stall timer should also fire if a single Bedrock API call exceeds a configured per-call timeout. Concretely: start a per-call timer just before `client.messages.create()` and cancel it when the call returns (success or error). If the timer fires, cancel the AbortController and treat it as a stall. The per-call timeout can be shorter than `stallTimeoutSeconds` (e.g. 90s per call vs 120s between calls) or configured separately.

**Implementation:** `AgentLoop._runLoop()` already has the stall timer mechanism (`stallTimeoutMs`). Adding a per-call `AbortSignal` with a timeout, or wrapping `client.messages.create()` in a `Promise.race` with a timeout promise, would close the gap. The `AbortController` approach is cleaner since the SDK accepts an AbortSignal in request options.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the right per-call timeout? Haiku can legitimately take 90s on a complex response. Sonnet can take longer. The timeout should be model-tier-aware, or at minimum configurable via `agentConfig.callTimeoutSeconds`.
- Should a per-call timeout count as a stall (same abort path) or as a retryable error (try again once before aborting)?

### Bedrock credential expiry detection and re-auth notification (May 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 14** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:3 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

AWS SSO credentials expire every ~8 hours. When they expire mid-session, `AnthropicBedrock()` throws `Could not load credentials from any providers` and the session dies silently. The operator only discovers this by noticing sessions stopped completing or by checking the terminal.

**What's needed:**
- Detect Bedrock credential errors specifically at the agent-client or agent-loop level (they manifest as SDK errors before any API call returns, distinct from model errors or API 400s)
- On detection: fire a macOS notification "WorkTrain needs AWS re-auth -- run: aws sso login --profile <profile>" and write to the outbox so `worktrain inbox` surfaces it
- Optionally: retry the session automatically after a configurable delay (to allow the operator to re-authenticate without losing the session)

**Refresh behavior:** `AnthropicBedrock()` reads from `~/.aws/sso/cache/` on each call -- so refreshing SSO while the daemon is running (`aws sso login`) is picked up automatically without a daemon restart. The notification just needs to tell the operator to do that.

**Implementation:** detect in `buildAgentClient()` or in the agent loop error handler in `agent-loop.ts` -- the credential error surfaces as a non-200 response from the SDK before any model call succeeds. Tag it as a distinct `WorkflowRunError` reason code (`credential_expired`) so the operator outbox message is specific.

### Parent-child session tree in console: link spawned sessions to their parent (May 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:3 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

When `spawn_agent` creates child sessions, `session_created.data.parentSessionId` is written to the session store. The data is already there. The console currently shows all sessions as a flat list, so a `wr.mr-review` run producing 8-10 parallel reviewer family sessions looks like unrelated noise.

**What's needed:** read `parentSessionId` from `session_created` events in the session list projection and render child sessions nested under their parent in the console UI. At minimum, each child session should show "child of `<parentId>`" and be visually grouped or indented under the parent. A tree view would be ideal.

**Two display modes worth supporting:**
1. **Grouped/nested**: child sessions indented under parent in the session list, collapsed by default, expanding on click. Shows the full spawn tree for complex pipelines.
2. **Parent indicator on child**: simpler fallback -- each child session shows a "↳ spawned by `<parentId>`" badge and a link to jump to the parent session.

**Implementation notes:** `parentSessionId` is written on the `session_created` event's `data` field. The console session list endpoint (`GET /api/v2/sessions`) reads the session store -- adding a `parentSessionId` field to `ConsoleSessionSummary` is the entry point. The UI change is additive on top of that.

**Things to hash out:**
- Should orphaned children (parent session already deleted/archived) show a greyed-out parent indicator or no indicator at all?
- The tree can be arbitrarily deep (spawn_agent allows up to depth 3 by default). Does the UI need to handle 3-level nesting, or is 1-level (parent → direct children) sufficient for now?

### Live turn-level log stream for active sessions (May 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:3 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The console shows step-level progress (which workflow phase the session is on) but nothing at the turn level: which tool the agent called, what it returned, how long it took, what the agent said between tool calls. Diagnosing a slow or stuck session currently requires grepping through raw conversation JSONL files -- not practical while a session is live.

**What's needed:** a `worktrain logs --follow <sessionId>` CLI command (and/or a "Live" tab in the console) that streams tool-call-level activity as it happens:

```
[09:52:14] Turn 12  Bash       → cd /worktrees/abc && npx vitest run
[09:52:31] Turn 12  Bash       ← exit 0, 396 tests pass  [17s]
[09:52:31] Turn 13  complete_step → phase-2-scope-and-completeness
[09:52:31] ADVANCE  phase-2 → phase-3-state-hypothesis
[09:53:02] Turn 14  Bash       → gh pr diff 1022
[09:53:04] Turn 14  Bash       ← 847 lines  [2s]
```

**The data already exists.** `DaemonEventEmitter` fires `tool_called`, `tool_error`, `step_advanced`, and `session_completed` events on every turn. The conversation JSONL captures every message. The gap is purely presentation -- nothing consumes these events into a human-readable live feed.

**Two surfaces:**
1. `worktrain logs --follow <sessionId>` -- CLI command, streams to stdout, pipe-friendly. Reads from the daemon event stream (JSONL file in `~/.workrail/data/`) and tails it in real time.
2. Console "Live" tab -- same data in the browser, auto-updating without refresh. Especially useful for long-running sessions where you want to keep an eye without a terminal.

**Things to hash out:**
- How much of the tool output to show inline vs. truncate? A `gh pr diff` result is 800 lines; showing all of it destroys the log readability. Proposal: first 3 lines + byte count for long outputs; full output available via `--verbose`.
- Should `worktrain logs` work for completed sessions too (replay)? Yes -- same format, just not tailing. `worktrain logs <sessionId>` (no `--follow`) replays the full conversation history in readable form.
- LLM text output between tool calls: show it? Yes, but dim/indented. The agent's reasoning is valuable for debugging wrong decisions.
- Should the console Live tab replace the existing session detail view or augment it? Augment -- step-level detail stays, Live tab adds the turn-level stream as a separate tab.

**Status: bug** | Priority: low

The Workflows tab shows bundled workflows (e.g. `coding-task-workflow-agentic`) as coming from "User Library" instead of "WorkRail Built-in". This is a WorkRail MCP server issue, not a WorkTrain issue.

**Likely cause:** The `source.kind` field is incorrectly set when a workflow exists in both the bundled set AND a user's managed sources or remembered roots.

**Where to look:**
- `src/infrastructure/storage/schema-validating-workflow-storage.ts` -- source kind propagation
- `src/mcp/handlers/shared/workflow-source-visibility.ts` -- display label mapping in `list_workflows`
- `src/infrastructure/storage/file-workflow-storage.ts` -- how `source.kind` is assigned when loading from disk

### Task picker mode: browse and launch available work (Apr 29, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

**Problem:** Once WorkTrain is configured (workspace set up, triggers.yml written, daemon running), there is still no easy way to say "run this workflow now" from the console. Dispatch requires knowing the API or writing a webhook. The console has a dispatch endpoint but no UI to drive it.

**Vision:** A console panel that lists the triggers already configured in triggers.yml and lets the user click one to fire it immediately -- without leaving the browser, without touching the API, without writing YAML.

**How it works:**
1. Console calls `GET /api/v2/triggers` to list all triggers loaded by the daemon.
2. User sees a list: trigger ID, workflow, goal, last-fired timestamp. Clicks "Run".
3. Console POSTs to `/api/v2/auto/dispatch` (already implemented) with the trigger's workflowId + goal + workspace.
4. New session appears in the session list immediately. User watches the DAG advance live.
5. On completion: outcome, PR link (if opened), and step notes all visible in the same panel.

**What this is not:** An onboarding wizard or zero-setup flow -- the daemon and environment must already be configured. This is a dispatch surface for *already-configured* users who want to trigger work without using the CLI or waiting for a webhook.

**Why it matters:** Makes the console a control plane, not just a read-only viewer. The daemon gains a "run this now" button. Users get to watch the agent work in real time, which builds confidence before trusting it on unattended tasks.

**Dependency:** `GET /api/v2/triggers` endpoint (returns the live trigger index -- may need to be added). `POST /api/v2/auto/dispatch` already exists. No new daemon work required.

**Things to hash out:**
- When the user clicks "Run" on a trigger that requires a dynamic goal (not a static one), where does the goal come from? Is there a text input, or is it required to be a static-goal trigger?
- Should manual dispatch from the console count against `maxConcurrentSessions`? Or is it a privileged path that bypasses the queue?
- The console is described as read-only in AGENTS.md. Does adding dispatch capability change its security model? Is there authentication needed before dispatch is permitted?
- If the daemon is not running when the user clicks "Run", what is the UX? Silent failure, immediate error, or auto-start attempt?
- Should this panel also allow stopping or pausing running sessions, or is dispatch the only write operation?

- **Node selection highlight** -- selected node should pulse or glow, not just change border color
- **Live session pulse** -- sessions with `status: in_progress` could have a subtle periodic animation
- **Tooltip polish** -- fade in/out rather than appearing instantly

**Design constraint:** Dark navy, amber accent aesthetic. Additions should reinforce this language.

**Where to start:** `console/src/components/RunLineageDag.tsx`. The tooltip pattern (`handleNodeMouseEnter`/`handleNodeMouseLeave`) already exists; a hover glow is a natural peer addition.

**Related:** `docs/design/console-cyberpunk-ui-discovery.md`, `docs/design/console-ui-backlog.md`

**Things to hash out:**
- CSS animations on many simultaneously live nodes can cause layout thrash and frame drops. Is there a performance budget or a maximum animated-node count before animations are disabled?
- The dark navy + amber aesthetic is established but not formally documented as a design token system. Should a design token file be established before adding more visual elements?
- Live session pulse animations may be distracting when many sessions are running. Should animation be suppressible via a user preference?

**Gap:** Users currently see only `node_created`/`edge_created`, which makes legitimate engine behavior look like missing workflow phases. Fast paths, skipped phases, condition evaluation, and loop gates are invisible.

**Recommended direction:**
- Keep phases as authoring/workflow-organization concepts
- Add an engine-trace/decision layer showing: selected next step, evaluated conditions, entered/exited loops, important run context variables (e.g. `taskComplexity`), skipped/bypassed planning paths

**Phase 1:** Extend console service/DTOs with a run-scoped execution-trace summary. Show a compact "engine decisions" strip or timeline above the DAG.

**Phase 2:** Richer explainability timeline with branches, skipped phases, condition results. Toggle between "execution DAG" and "engine trace" views.

**Things to hash out:**
- Engine decisions (evaluated conditions, skipped steps) are not currently captured as session events -- they exist only in memory during the run. What new event types need to be added to the session store to make this work?
- How does the "engine decisions" strip stay useful without becoming overwhelming for complex workflows with many branches and loop iterations?
- Should condition variable values (e.g. `taskComplexity=Small`) be visible in the trace? This surfaces potentially sensitive session context in a UI accessible to anyone with console access.

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

Currently, workflows like `wr.coding-task` are monolithic and generic. To adapt them for specific domains (like UI, Kotlin, or backend), operators must either author completely separate workflow files (creating maintenance duplication) or accept generic prompts that miss domain-specific guidelines. There is no first-class way to parameterize a workflow session with a specific "flavor" that alters its prompts, injected guidelines, or verification gates while retaining a single canonical DAG definition.

**Things to hash out:**
- Should the "flavor" be explicitly configured in the trigger/session start, or dynamically inferred by the coordinator looking at the files touched in the workspace?
- How should flavor-specific prompt additions be structured? Can we avoid inline JSON string bloat in `promptFragments` by using the reference system (`references` pointing to clean `.md` files) and just dynamically linking/injecting references based on the flavor?
- Can a workflow support multiple simultaneous flavors (e.g., both `kotlin` and `backend`), or should it be restricted to a single primary flavor?
- Does this compose cleanly with global `metaGuidance` template injection, allowing stack-specific rulesets to be injected workflow-wide without cluttering individual step JSON files?

### Remove human_approval gate from wr.mr-review final handoff step (May 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:3 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The `wr.mr-review` workflow's final handoff step (`phase-6-final-handoff`) uses `requireConfirmation: { kind: "human_approval" }` before posting the draft review to GitHub. This gate is redundant with GitHub's own draft review mechanism -- a draft review is not published until the operator explicitly submits it on GitHub. The gate currently parks the session at a local `gate_parked` state, requiring the operator to respond via `worktrain inbox respond` before anything reaches GitHub. This doubles the number of required human interactions and makes the workflow less useful for overnight autonomous operation. Since the agent posts a *draft* (not a published) review, the operator retains full control via GitHub's native submit button -- the local gate adds friction without adding safety.

**Things to hash out:**
- Should the gate be removed entirely, or replaced with a post-delivery check (confirm the draft posted successfully before completing)?
- Does removing the gate affect how `coordinator_eval` gates upstream (phase-0, phase-5) are evaluated -- are they still correct without the final human gate?
- What happens on a `blocking` verdict -- should the workflow still park for operator input in that case even without the standard gate?

### Pre-specialized expert agents: on-demand consultants for main agents (May 7, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The main agent running a coding, review, or investigation workflow is not the expert. It is the orchestrator. When it needs specialized input -- "is this Kotlin idiomatic?", "does this violate any payments module invariants?", "what are the FP patterns this codebase uses for this?" -- it should be able to ask a pre-specialized consultant agent and get a bounded, expert answer back.

These expert agents are not running the main workflow. They do not own any phase or make any final decisions. They are consulted: spawned with a specific question, pre-loaded with dense expertise in a specific domain, and they return a bounded answer. The main agent synthesizes the input and retains full ownership.

**Examples:**
- A Kotlin idioms expert pre-loaded with Kotlin best practices, common pitfalls, and idiomatic patterns -- queried when the coding or review agent wants to know "is this idiomatic Kotlin?"
- A functional programming expert pre-loaded with the FP philosophy and patterns relevant to this codebase (from CLAUDE.md, design docs, etc.) -- queried when the agent is making decisions that touch FP style
- A payments module expert pre-loaded with the payments execution paths, known invariants, and past design decisions -- queried when the task touches payments code
- A security expert pre-loaded with the codebase's auth model, known vulnerabilities, and security invariants -- queried during review of auth-adjacent changes

**Two distinct usage patterns -- both valid:**

*Consultant mode:* The main agent mid-task asks a specific question ("is this Kotlin idiomatic?"), a pre-specialized agent is spawned with that question and its expertise briefing, it returns a bounded answer, the main agent synthesizes and moves on. Lightweight, on-demand, the main agent drives the interaction.

*Parallel specialist mode:* The coordinator spawns multiple pre-specialized agents simultaneously for a phase of work -- e.g. an MR review that launches a Kotlin expert, a payments module expert, and an FP patterns expert in parallel, each reviewing the same diff through their lens. The main agent or coordinator synthesizes. This is the 3-angle executor pattern from wr.discovery applied to expertise curation rather than framing angles. Each specialist contributes their perspective; no single agent has to cover everything.

The parallel specialist mode is conceptually similar to the existing reviewer families in wr.mr-review, but with expertise injection replacing role prompts. "You are a correctness reviewer" and "you are an agent briefed on this codebase's actual invariants, the past bugs in this module, and the specific patterns we use here" are very different levels of specificity.

**What makes expert consultants distinct from existing reviewer families (MR review):**
Existing reviewer families are top-level sessions running the full review workflow independently. Expert consultants (in consultant mode) are lightweight bounded spawns -- more like calling a function than running a parallel pipeline. In parallel specialist mode they are closer to reviewer families, but curated for the specific task rather than generically role-assigned.

**What makes this distinct from existing context injection:**
Existing context injection (living work context, assembledContextSummary) threads pipeline state between phases -- history of what happened. Expert consultants carry curated domain expertise -- best practices, idioms, invariants, patterns. The content type is different: not "what was done" but "what is true about this domain."

**Implementation shape -- specialized workflows, not just context injection:**

The most powerful form of a specialist is not an agent that receives a big expertise briefing at spawn time and then works freely. It is an agent running a purpose-built specialized workflow that contains both the expertise and the process for applying it systematically.

A `wr.kotlin-review` workflow contains: the Kotlin expertise in `metaGuidance` and `references`, and a structured procedure -- "step 1: check null safety patterns at these call sites; step 2: evaluate coroutine usage against these criteria; step 3: check data class conventions..." Breaking the domain into steps ensures the specialist covers everything the domain requires, in the right order, with the right depth. A pure context dump leaves coverage to chance; a workflow enforces it.

This also makes specialists auditable: you can see in the session store exactly which steps the specialist ran, what it found, and whether it covered all required dimensions. And specialized workflows improve over time via `wr.workflow-for-workflows`, compounding quality the same way all bundled workflows do.

For dynamic specialists (payments module expert, specific subsystem expert), the workflow defines the process for generating the briefing dynamically -- walk these execution paths, read these design docs, extract these invariants -- rather than containing a static briefing.

**What needs to be built:**
- A catalog of specialized workflows: static domain specialists (wr.kotlin-review, wr.fp-patterns-review) and dynamic module specialists (wr.module-expert with a briefing-generation phase)
- A matching mechanism: given the task's affected files and domains, which specialist workflows are relevant?
- A consultation protocol: how does the main agent query a specialist? How does the specialist return a typed artifact the main agent can act on?
- Dynamic briefing generation: for module-specific specialists, a workflow phase that walks affected execution paths and generates the curated briefing before the expert work begins

**Relationship to existing entries:**
- "Knowledge graph": the long-term structural ground truth version of this. Expert briefings are the lower-cost precursor that doesn't require the full graph.
- "Assumption store": verified codebase facts are one input to the module expert briefing.
- "Coordinator mid-session hooks": expert consultation could be triggered mid-session by the coordinator when specific signals fire (e.g. agent touches a known-tricky module).

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the right format for an expertise briefing? Prose vs structured facts vs a combination?
- How are static briefings maintained? They go stale as language versions change and codebases evolve.
- How are dynamic briefings generated? Static analysis? LLM-assisted code walk? What is the cost and freshness guarantee?
- How does the main agent know which experts are available and when to consult them? Explicit workflow step, or opportunistic mid-task consultation?
- Token budget: expert consultation adds turns and tokens. When is the cost worth it vs. the main agent just proceeding with its own judgment?
- How does the consultation differ from just giving the main agent a bigger context window? The answer should be "specificity and freshness" -- a consultant briefed on this specific module is better than a general agent with everything injected.

### Automatic root cause analysis when MR review finds issues post-coding (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

When an MR review session (run by a WorkTrain agent) finds issues in a coding session's output, WorkTrain should automatically investigate why the coding agent missed it and determine whether the workflow, the prompts, or the process can be improved.

**Two distinct triggers:**

1. **WorkTrain MR review finds something**: after a WorkTrain review session produces findings, the coordinator should automatically spawn an analysis session asking: why did the coding agent produce code with this issue? Was it a workflow gap (missing verification step, insufficient scrutiny at a phase), a prompt gap (the agent wasn't told to check this), or a context gap (the agent didn't have the information needed)?

2. **Human finds something post-review**: when a human reviewer comments on or requests changes to a PR that already passed WorkTrain's review, this is doubly significant -- it means both the coding agent AND the review agent missed it. WorkTrain should automatically investigate why both missed it and whether the review workflow has a systematic blind spot.

**Why this matters**: every finding that slips through is a signal about a workflow or process gap. Today that signal is lost. Capturing it systematically and feeding it back into workflow improvement closes the quality loop.

**Concrete model:** CodeRabbit does this for MR reviews -- when a human reviewer corrects a CodeRabbit finding or points out something it missed, CodeRabbit extracts a structured learning (`{ claim, repo, file context, timestamp }`) and injects it into future review sessions for the same repo. WorkTrain should do the same, and broader: learnings from coding corrections (not just review corrections) feed into the per-workspace codebase assumption store, which directly addresses Subtype B intent failures. Human feedback on WorkTrain's PRs is the write path for that store.

**Things to hash out:**
- How does WorkTrain detect that a human has commented on a PR post-review? This requires monitoring the PR for new review activity after WorkTrain's session completed -- either webhook events or polling.
- What does the analysis session actually produce? A structured finding about the gap? A concrete proposal for workflow improvement? Both?
- Who reviews the analysis output before it becomes a workflow change? Auto-applying workflow changes based on analysis is risky.
- How do you distinguish "the workflow is fine but this was a genuinely hard edge case" from "the workflow has a systematic gap"? A single miss doesn't prove a gap; multiple misses of the same kind do.
- Should the analysis result feed directly into `workflow-effectiveness-assessment`, or is it a separate concern?
- For the "coding agent missed it" case: is the right fix to change the coding workflow, or to make the review workflow more adversarial?
- How are codebase-specific learnings extracted from free-form human review comments? A structured extraction step (similar to CodeRabbit's learning extraction) is needed to turn "actually this is wrong because X" into a typed store entry.
- How are extracted learnings scoped and invalidated over time? Per-repo scope is right for codebase-specific facts, but learnings go stale after refactors. A `lastVerified` + staleness mechanism is needed.
- Relationship to the assumption store (Candidate 2 from the intent gap discovery): human PR corrections are the primary write path for the per-workspace codebase assumption store. These two entries should be designed together.

Fleet analysis (May 9, 2026) of 75 daemon discovery sessions revealed: 6 sessions completed successfully in 17-43 minutes on the workrail codebase itself. 28+ sessions hit exactly 30.0 minutes -- the daemon's `DEFAULT_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES = 30` in `src/daemon/core/session-context.ts`. Sessions dispatched via the adaptive pipeline coordinator correctly get 55 minutes (`DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS`) and succeed when they reach that budget. Sessions dispatched directly (via webhook trigger, `worktrain spawn`, or any path that doesn't go through the coordinator) inherit the 30-minute default and always fail.

**Fix:** Raise `DEFAULT_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` from 30 to 60 in `src/daemon/core/session-context.ts`. The successful sessions complete in 17-43 minutes; 60 minutes is sufficient headroom. Additionally, the `maxTurns=50` hits (~12 sessions) suggest some dispatch path is setting an explicit 50-turn cap -- trace the origin and raise or remove it.

**Why this is the #1 MVP blocker:** wr.discovery completing reliably is a prerequisite for the full adaptive pipeline (discovery → shaping → coding → review → merge). Without it, every pipeline run fails at phase 1.

Key changes: all three assessment gates now have `assessmentConsequences` that block on failure; Phase 3d/3e split isolates external challenge from fresh-context selection; typed `SelectionOutput` tier (`strong_recommendation | provisional_recommendation | insufficient_signal`) driven by observable signals; `FrameValidityCheck` at landscape-to-frame transition; verbalized sampling + ordinary persona rotation in executor goal strings; `recommendationConfidenceBand` downgrade-only invariant across resolution phases; Phase 6 restructured as falsification-shaped fresh-context validator; `selectionTier` added to `wr.discovery_handoff` artifact.

### wr.discovery lacks domain-specific ideation guidance (May 6, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

`wr.discovery` classifies `problemDomain` (software / product / ux / personal / general) and uses it for a few things -- philosophy source lookup, vision doc location, and `decisionCriteria` examples. But candidate generation, challenge framing, and resolution path guidance do not adapt to domain at all. A personal career decision, a product strategy question, and a software architecture problem have meaningfully different ideation patterns, different failure modes in candidate generation, different challenge rubrics, and different resolution artifacts. The workflow currently treats them all identically after `problemDomain` is set.

The result is that `problemDomain` is a classification that carries almost no behavioral weight past phase-0 and phase-2. It reads well but does not change the actual work.

**Things to hash out:**
- Where is domain-specific guidance most needed? Candidate generation (different ideation patterns per domain) and challenge framing (different adversarial angles) are the clearest gaps. Are there others -- resolution mode selection, confidence dimensions, handoff format?
- What is the right mechanism -- `promptFragments` conditioned on `problemDomain`, a domain-specific routine injected via `templateCall`, or richer domain context blocks injected at workflow start? The answer probably varies by where in the workflow the guidance applies.
- How much domain specificity is enough? Software vs non-software is the biggest gap. Within non-software, personal vs product vs ux are also meaningfully different. Is a two-level split (software / general) sufficient for now, or is the full five-way split worth tackling immediately?
- Are there domain-specific output formats worth considering? A personal decision probably ends with a different handoff shape than a software architecture decision -- different fields, different confidence dimensions, different "next actions" structure.

### wr.discovery anchors candidates to existing infrastructure instead of the ideal solution (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 11** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

`wr.discovery` produces candidates bounded by what already exists. The landscape step grounds the agent in the current codebase, which anchors candidate generation to what is buildable today rather than what would be best. On a discovery run for context-passing, for example, candidates are shaped by the current pre-load architecture instead of questioning whether pre-load is the right model at all. Decisions that should be challenged by the discovery process are instead silently inherited from it.

The result is that discovery optimizes within the current design space rather than finding the edge of it. Problems that require restructuring existing code -- not just adding to it -- tend to produce timid candidates that paper over the root cause instead of addressing it. Discovery is supposed to find the best answer; it is currently finding the best answer that doesn't require changing much.

**Things to hash out:**
- Should the ideal-first reasoning happen before or after the landscape pass? Before risks ignoring hard constraints; after risks being anchored by them. What is the right sequencing, and is it always the same or does it depend on the problem type?
- How do non-negotiable constraints (e.g. "must not change the engine API", "must work without a running daemon") get introduced without becoming the excuse for avoiding the best answer? There's a real difference between a hard constraint and an inherited assumption that could be challenged.
- Is "what would the ideal look like, and what's the migration path from here?" a step inside discovery, or does it belong in `wr.shaping`? Shaping already produces an appetite and scope cut -- is ideal-first reasoning a discovery concern or a shaping concern, or does each need it independently?
- When the ideal requires multi-sprint groundwork (e.g. "first build the KG, then build context assembly on top of it"), how should discovery represent that? As a sequenced multi-phase candidate? As a separate "phase 1" item that gets its own discovery?

### Workflow previewer for compiled and runtime behavior

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Add a workflow previewer for the `workflows/` directory that shows what a workflow actually compiles to and how the engine can traverse it at runtime.

**Why:** Authors currently have to mentally reconstruct branching, loops, blocked-node behavior, and other runtime structure from authored JSON plus tests. Advanced workflow authoring gets much easier when the compiled DAG and runtime edges are visible.

**What it should show:** compiled step graph/DAG; branch points and condition-driven paths; loop structure and loop-control edges; blocked/resumed/checkpoint-related node shapes; template/routine expansion boundaries; the gap between authored JSON structure and runtime execution structure.

**Design questions:**
- Should this live in the existing Console, as a dev-only page, or as a local authoring utility?
- Should it show only the compiled DAG, or also annotate likely runtime transitions such as blocked attempts, rewinds, and loop continuations?
- How much provenance should it expose for injected routines/templates?

Start as a read-only preview for bundled workflows; optimize for accuracy over polish.

**Things to hash out:**
- Should the previewer live in the existing Console, as a dev-only page, or as a local authoring utility (CLI command)?
- Should it show only the compiled DAG, or also annotate likely runtime transitions such as blocked attempts, rewinds, and loop continuations?
- How much provenance should it expose for injected routines/templates? Is it useful to show the boundary between authored steps and expanded routine steps?
- Does the previewer need to show all possible DAG paths, or only the "happy path"? For deeply conditional workflows, all-paths could be very large.
- Is this only useful during workflow authoring, or also useful for operators who want to understand a running session's possible future states?

### Native assessment / decision gates for workflows

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Add a first-class workflow primitive for structured assessments that can drive routing. The agent would assess a small set of named dimensions, give short rationales, and let the engine use explicit aggregation/gate rules to influence continuation, follow-up, branching, or final confidence.

**Why:** Some workflow decisions are clearer and more auditable as small assessment matrices than as long prompt prose. Confidence computation is a strong example: workflows may want to derive final confidence from dimensions like boundary, intent, evidence, coverage, and disagreement.

**Near-term shape:** keep reasoning with the agent, but let the workflow declare named assessment dimensions and allowed levels such as `High | Medium | Low`. Let the agent provide one short rationale per dimension. Let the engine compute caps/next actions/routing outcomes from explicit gate rules.

**Ownership split:** the agent assesses each dimension and gives the short rationale; the engine applies declared gate rules.

**Good early use cases:** MR review confidence assessment; planning readiness/confidence gates; debugging confidence and next-step routing; block-vs-continue/revisit-earlier-step decisions.

**Design questions:** should this be a narrow `assessmentGate` primitive or a more generic structured decision-table feature? Should reusable matrices be inline first, or backed by repo-owned refs? How should assessment provenance and rationales appear in compiled/runtime traces?

**Things to hash out:**
- When the agent provides a rationale for each dimension, is that rationale stored in the session event log and surfaced in the console? Or is it ephemeral?
- How does the engine enforce that the agent assessed all required dimensions before advancing? Is this a schema-validated output contract, or a soft expectation?
- If the engine applies gate rules and routes the session differently than the agent expected, how is that decision communicated back to the agent in the next step's context?
- Are assessment dimensions per-workflow or could they be shared across workflows via a named reference? What is the right reuse model?
- What is the relationship between this primitive and the existing `assessmentConsequenceTrigger` in assessment gates v1?

Add an opt-in execution-contract or note-structure feature that helps agents produce compact notes useful to both humans and future resume agents.

Some workflows want notes to consistently capture current understanding, key findings, decisions, uncertainties, and next-step implications. This is related to assessment-driven routing, but it is a different product concern.

**Open question:** should note scaffolding live as a separate execution-contract feature, or share underlying primitives with assessment gates?

**Things to hash out:**
- What does "opt-in" mean here -- a workflow-level flag, a step-level annotation, or a per-session config? Who decides whether a given workflow gets note scaffolding?
- Note structure injects requirements into what the agent writes. Does this constrain the agent's ability to express nuanced or non-standard findings that don't fit the scaffold?
- Are scaffolded notes stored differently from unstructured notes, or is the structure a soft suggestion that gets serialized the same way?
- If the scaffold template changes between workflow versions, are older session notes still readable/comparable to newer ones?

### Targeted session review: extract high-signal moments instead of reviewing full transcripts (May 6, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 12** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Reviewing a full agent session transcript to evaluate quality is prohibitively expensive -- long sessions have hundreds of tool calls, file reads, and reasoning steps. But most of the signal about whether a session went well lives in a small number of high-signal moments: confirmation gates, places where the agent flagged uncertainty or divergence, steps where the agent's output failed to match the expected contract, and points where the agent encountered reality and had to adapt. Reviewing those moments selectively is 10-50x cheaper than reading the full transcript and captures most of the quality signal.

**High-signal moments worth targeting:**

1. **Confirmation gate outcomes** -- when a `requireConfirmation` gate fired, what did the agent report? Did it accurately represent the state of the work? Was the decision the right one in hindsight?

2. **Agent self-reported issues** -- calls to `report_issue` or `signal_coordinator` during the session. These are the agent's own flags that something was wrong. Each one warrants inspection: was the issue real, was the agent's characterization accurate, was the resolution appropriate?

3. **Contract validation failures** -- steps where the engine returned a `blocked` or `require_followup` response. The agent's output failed the output contract. What did it produce, and why?

4. **Agent-workflow friction points** -- places where the agent deviated from the expected step procedure, added divergence markers, or explicitly noted a gap between the workflow instructions and the reality it encountered. These are the inputs to workflow improvement.

5. **Interpretation vs outcome delta** -- the gap between what the agent stated it was building (interpretation checkpoint, once it exists) and what it actually produced. The delta is the intent gap in concrete form.

6. **Sycophancy signals** -- position changes without new evidence, position reversals after challenge, confidence-accuracy mismatches visible in the notes.

**Why this matters:** without targeted review, session quality is only observable at the PR level (did the output pass review?). That's a lagging indicator that catches failures after they've shipped cost. Targeted review of high-signal moments catches failures mid-session or immediately post-session, before the cost compounds.

**Relationship to existing entries:**
- "Agent-reportable workflow bugs" (below) -- the agent's own flags are one of the primary review targets
- "Synthetic human gates" -- the targeted review output is what a synthetic gate would consume to make an approval decision
- "Automatic root cause analysis" -- targeted review is the cheaper precursor that identifies which sessions warrant full root cause analysis
- "Per-run workflow improvement retrospective" -- the session retrospective is one moment in the targeted review; this entry is about the full set of moments across a session

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the right extraction mechanism? The session event log already records every tool call, step advance, and artifact. A targeted review agent reads selected event types rather than the full log. What is the right query interface?
- Which moments are always reviewed vs. sampled? Confirmation gates and `report_issue` calls probably warrant 100% review; routine step advances can be sampled.
- Should targeted review happen synchronously (coordinator waits before proceeding) or asynchronously (review happens in parallel, findings surface to operator outbox)?
- How are review findings acted on? They could feed into: (a) the synthetic gate decision for the current session, (b) the workflow improvement retrospective, (c) the assumption store if codebase-specific learnings are extracted.
- What does the targeted review agent actually produce? A structured verdict per moment reviewed, a severity-tagged list of concerns, or a binary pass/fail?

Agents encounter problems with WorkTrain itself during runs -- confusing step prompts, broken output contracts, workflow logic that doesn't match the actual task, MCP tool bugs, unclear instructions. Right now there's no structured way for an agent to surface these. They either silently work around the issue or get stuck.

A mechanism for agents to report problems with the WorkRail system itself during a session -- distinct from `report_issue` (which is for the task). These reports should be visible to the operator and feed into workflow improvement.

**Things to hash out:**
- How does an agent decide whether a problem is a workflow bug vs a task obstacle? The boundary is fuzzy -- a confusing step prompt might just be a hard task.
- Does surfacing this tool change agent behavior in undesirable ways? Agents might blame the workflow instead of solving the problem.
- Should reports survive session cleanup, or is their lifetime tied to the session?
- Who owns acting on these reports -- the operator, the workflow author, or an automated system?
- Should this be available in interactive (MCP) sessions, or daemon sessions only?
- Relationship to "Targeted session review": agent-reported workflow bugs are one of the primary high-signal moments that targeted session review would extract and inspect.

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Every workflow run is an opportunity to learn. At the end of each session, the agent has unique insight into what worked, what was unclear, what slowed it down, and what a better version of the workflow would look like. This insight currently evaporates when the session ends.

At the end of each session, the agent should have an opportunity to reflect on the process itself -- what was confusing, what took longer than it should, what context was missing, what it would change about the workflow.

**Things to hash out:**
- Is agent reflection on its own process reliable? Agents may lack the self-awareness to accurately identify what went wrong, or may default to saying everything was fine.
- Does this add unacceptable cost or latency for short/fast workflows? Should it be conditional on certain outcomes (e.g. only after a stuck or timeout result)?
- How does retrospective data get used? Who reads it, and does it feed automatically into workflow improvement proposals or require human triage first?
- Risk of agents gaming it -- saying the workflow was perfect to appear compliant rather than critical.
- Should this be opt-in per workflow, universal, or triggered by specific signals during the run?

### Verification and proof as first-class citizens (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs coordinator infrastructure)

**The problem:** today there's no single place that tells you "here's everything that was done to verify this feature is correct." Tests pass, a review ran, an audit happened -- but it's scattered across session notes, PR descriptions, CI logs, and half-remembered conversations. No verification chain.

**The vision:** every shipped change has a **proof record** -- a structured document that answers: what was built, how was it verified, by whom (which agents), and what was the verdict at each gate. Not a summary for humans -- a queryable record that the coordinator and watchdog can use to enforce quality gates.

A proof record contains: `prNumber`, `goal`, `verificationChain` (array of `{ kind, outcome, findings, sessionId, timestamp }`), `gates` (unit_tests, mr_review, production_audit, architecture_audit), `overallVerdict`, `mergedAt`.

**Verification gates the coordinator enforces:**
| Gate | Required for |
|------|-------------|
| Unit tests pass | All changes |
| MR review approved (no Critical/Major) | All changes |
| Architecture audit | `touchesArchitecture=true` or `riskLevel=High` |
| Production audit | `riskLevel=High` or affects prod paths |
| Security audit | touches auth/input/external |

**Visibility surfaces:** Console PR view (full verification chain, expandable to session notes); `worktrain verify <pr-number>` command; proof record section in every PR description ("Verification chain: 14 unit tests | MR review (0 findings) | Production audit | Architecture audit (skipped: riskLevel=Low)").

**Why this matters:** "Has this been reviewed and audited?" becomes a query against proof records rather than reading through PRs and session notes. The knowledge graph stores these records. The watchdog checks them on a schedule. The coordinator gates on them before merging. Verification becomes infrastructure, not process.

**Things to hash out:**
- Proof records are associated with PRs, but WorkTrain sessions may span multiple PRs, or a PR may be created by a human after WorkTrain's work. How is the PR-to-session mapping established?
- Who writes the proof record -- the coordinator script (after each gate completes), the delivery pipeline (at merge time), or both incrementally?
- What is the storage model for proof records -- append-only event log (like sessions), a separate file per PR, or entries in the knowledge graph? Each has different query characteristics.
- "The coordinator gates on them before merging" requires the coordinator to read the proof record at merge time. What happens when the proof record is incomplete (a gate ran but its result was not recorded)?
- How does this interact with PRs that are merged manually by humans, bypassing the coordinator's merge gate? The proof record would be incomplete but the merge already happened.

### Coordinator mid-session hooks: react to workflow events without waiting for session completion (May 6, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 12** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The coordinator currently acts only between sessions -- it spawns a session, awaits its completion, reads the typed output artifact, and decides what to do next. It has no mechanism to react to events that happen inside a running session. This means the coordinator cannot spawn helper agents mid-session (e.g. an external assumption ranker when the interpretation checkpoint fires), cannot intercept a confirmation gate and satisfy it autonomously, and cannot act on a step completion artifact before the full session finishes.

The gap: workflow lifecycle events (step completed, gate fired, artifact emitted, `report_issue` called) are currently only visible after the session ends via the session store. The coordinator needs a way to subscribe to these events as they happen and act on them -- spawning agents, injecting steer messages, or making routing decisions -- without waiting for session completion.

**Concrete use cases this unlocks:**
- Spawn an external assumption-ranking agent when the interpretation checkpoint step completes, inject its ranking back into the session before verification runs
- Auto-satisfy a `requireConfirmation` gate in autonomous mode by running a synthetic gate evaluation and steering the session with the result
- Spawn a targeted review agent when a specific step artifact is emitted, surface findings before the session proceeds to the next phase
- React to a `report_issue` call mid-session by spawning an investigation agent immediately rather than waiting for the full session to fail

**What this requires:**
- A real-time or near-real-time event subscription mechanism from the coordinator to the session event log (the append-only JSONL already has all the events; the coordinator needs a watch/poll interface on it)
- A `steer` injection path from the coordinator into a running session (the steer endpoint already exists at `POST /sessions/:id/steer`)
- A coordinator hook registry: declarative rules of the form "when session X emits event type Y with artifact kind Z, execute hook H"

**Relationship to existing entries:**
- "Scripts-first coordinator" (below): the hooks would be coordinator scripts reacting to events, not LLM reasoning
- "Native multi-agent orchestration": `spawn_session` + `await_sessions` handles between-session orchestration; this handles within-session coordination
- "Workflow runtime adapter": mid-session hooks are how the daemon adapter satisfies `requireConfirmation` gates autonomously

**Things to hash out:**
- Poll vs push: the session event log is append-only JSONL. The coordinator can poll it efficiently (tail -f equivalent), but a proper event bus (the daemon event emitter already exists) would be cleaner. Which is the right mechanism?
- Hook registry format: declarative JSON rules in `triggers.yml`, or imperative TypeScript in the coordinator script? The declarative approach is more auditable; the imperative approach is more flexible.
- Ordering guarantees: if the coordinator injects a steer message in response to a step completion, does the session engine guarantee the steer is processed before the next step begins? Race condition risk.
- Blast radius: a hook that fires incorrectly (wrong event matched, wrong steer injected) could derail a running session in a hard-to-debug way. What are the rollback and auditability guarantees?

### Scripts-first coordinator: avoid the main agent wherever possible (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: partial** | Foundation shipped PR #908 (Apr 30, 2026)

**Score: 12** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

**What shipped:** `ChildSessionResult` discriminated union, `getChildSessionResult()`, `spawnAndAwait()`, `parentSessionId` threading, `wr.coordinator_result` artifact schema. The typed coordinator primitives that enable in-process coordinator scripts are now available.

**What's still needed:** the actual coordinator scripts (full development pipeline, bug-fix coordinator, grooming coordinator) and the `worktrain spawn`/`await` CLI commands that wrap these primitives for shell scripts.

**The insight:** In a coordinator workflow, the main agent spends most of its time on mechanical work -- reading PR lists, checking CI status, deciding whether findings are blocking, sequencing merges. That's all deterministic logic. An LLM is expensive, slow, and inconsistent for deterministic work.

**The principle:** the scripts-over-agent rule applies at the coordinator level too. The coordinator's job is to drive a DAG of child sessions. The DAG structure, routing decisions, and termination conditions should be scripts, not LLM reasoning.

**What this means concretely:** a coordinator script that calls `gh pr list`, spawns MR review sessions, awaits them, parses findings JSON, routes (clean -> merge queue, minor -> spawn fix agent, blocking -> escalate), awaits fix agents, and executes merge sequence when queue is empty. The LLM is only invoked for leaf work -- the actual MR review, the actual coding fix.

**What WorkTrain provides:**
- `worktrain spawn --workflow <id> --goal <text>` -> prints sessionHandle
- `worktrain await --sessions <handle1,handle2>` -> prints structured results JSON
- `worktrain merge --pr <number>` -> runs the merge sequence

The coordinator "workflow" is then a shell script or TypeScript file. Fully deterministic, fully auditable, no tokens burned on routing decisions.

**Build order:** `worktrain spawn`/`worktrain await` CLI commands; structured output format for leaf sessions (handoff artifact JSON block already exists); a reference `coordinator-groom-prs.sh` as the first coordinator template; Console DAG view updated to show coordinator-script-spawned sessions with parent-child relationships.

**Things to hash out:**
- `worktrain spawn` prints a `sessionHandle`. What is the format of this handle -- a session ID, an opaque token, or a structured JSON blob? The answer affects whether it can be safely passed between processes.
- `worktrain await` blocks until sessions complete. What is the behavior when a session crashes mid-run -- does `await` eventually return with an error, or block indefinitely?
- The coordinator is a shell script or TypeScript file, not a workflow. How does the coordinator's own execution get tracked in the session store or event log? Is it visible in the console?
- If the coordinator script is invoked by a trigger, who is responsible for the coordinator's lifecycle -- the daemon, or the OS (via launchd/cron)?
- How does a coordinator script handle partial failures (2 of 5 child sessions failed)? Is the failure handling logic in the script, or does WorkTrain provide a structured retry primitive?

### Full development pipeline: coordinator scripts drive multi-phase autonomous work (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs classify-task workflow + scripts-first coordinator)

The full pipeline DAG for feature implementation, driven by a coordinator script:

```
trigger: "implement feature X"
  -> [always] classify-task
       outputs: taskComplexity, riskLevel, hasUI, touchesArchitecture
  -> [if taskComplexity != Small] discovery
  -> [if hasUI] ux-design
  -> [if touchesArchitecture] architecture-design + arch-review (parallel)
  -> [always] coding-task (inputs: context bundle + design spec + arch decision)
  -> [always] mr-review
       -> [if clean] auto-commit -> auto-pr -> merge
       -> [if Minor/Nit] -> spawn fix agent -> re-review (max 3 passes)
       -> [if Critical/Major] -> escalate to human
  -> [if riskLevel == High] prod-risk-audit
  -> [if merged] notify
```

**The key insight:** the coordinator script reads `taskComplexity`, `riskLevel`, `hasUI`, and `touchesArchitecture` from the classify step's output and decides which phases to spawn. A one-line bug fix runs: classify -> coding-task -> mr-review. A new UI feature runs everything. Zero coordinator LLM calls.

**The missing workflow:** `classify-task-workflow` -- fast, 1-step, outputs taskComplexity/riskLevel/hasUI/touchesArchitecture. This is the single most important missing workflow -- without it, the coordinator has to spawn everything for every task, which is wasteful.

**Things to hash out:**
- The coordinator script is described as "scripts, not LLM" -- but the pipeline DAG itself requires reading and interpreting `classify-task-workflow` outputs. Who validates that the script correctly handles all classification outcomes?
- What is the fallback when `classify-task-workflow` fails or returns an inconclusive result? Does the pipeline abort, escalate, or default to the most conservative path?
- How are errors in the coordinator script itself handled? A bug in the script could skip phases silently or merge without required gates.
- Should the pipeline support human checkpoints between phases (e.g. "approve before coding starts"), or is it fully autonomous by design?
- Who owns the coordinator script -- the workflow author, the workspace operator, or WorkTrain itself? Different owners have different update cadences.

### Additional coordinator pipeline templates (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs scripts-first coordinator)

Beyond the feature implementation pipeline, three more coordinator templates are high value:

**Backlog grooming coordinator:**
```
trigger: "groom backlog" (cron: weekly, or manual dispatch)
  -> [for each open issue] classify-issue -> label-and-size
  -> [for stale issues > 90 days] auto-close-or-ping
  -> [for duplicate issues] detect-duplicates
  -> [for high-priority bugs with no assignee] spawn bug-investigation-agentic
  -> produce grooming summary -> post weekly digest to Slack
```

**Bug investigation + fix coordinator:**
```
trigger: new issue labeled "bug" OR incident alert
  -> bug-investigation-agentic
       outputs: root cause hypothesis, affected files, severity, confidence
  -> [if severity == Critical] page-oncall
  -> [if severity <= High and hypothesis_confidence >= 0.8] attempt-fix
       -> coding-task-workflow-agentic
       -> mr-review -> [if clean] auto-commit -> auto-pr
  -> close-or-update-issue
```

The daemon can go from "bug filed" to "fix merged" with zero human involvement for well-understood bugs with high-confidence hypotheses. The `hypothesis_confidence` output from the investigation gates the auto-fix attempt.

**Incident monitoring coordinator:**
```
trigger: monitoring alert (CPU spike, error rate, latency P99 > threshold)
  -> triage-alert (classify real incident vs noise)
  -> [if isRealIncident] investigate
  -> [if mitigation is config change] auto-mitigate (NEVER auto-rollback code without human approval)
  -> page-oncall with full context + session DAG link
```

The operator gets paged with a complete picture: what happened, likely why, what was already done automatically, and exactly what decision they need to make.

**Things to hash out:**
- The backlog grooming coordinator auto-closes stale issues. What prevents it from closing issues that are still relevant but have no recent activity by design (e.g. long-term architectural items)?
- The bug investigation + fix path is fully autonomous when `hypothesis_confidence >= 0.8`. How is that threshold validated? What is the cost of a false positive (fixing the wrong thing) at that confidence level?
- "NEVER auto-rollback code without human approval" is a correct hard rule, but "auto-mitigate (config change)" is still a significant action. Who defines what qualifies as a safe config change vs a risky one?
- The incident monitoring coordinator pages oncall. What is the integration path for paging -- PagerDuty, Slack, email? Is the paging mechanism configurable per workspace?
- How do these coordinator templates relate to the general-purpose scripts-first coordinator concept? Are they instances of the same pattern, or separate implementations?

### Interactive ideation: WorkTrain as a thinking partner with full project context (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 7** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs knowledge graph + project memory)

The ability to have a conversation with WorkTrain with full awareness of what's been built, what's in flight, what's in the backlog, and what decisions were made and why. Unlike Claude Code, WorkTrain already has: the session store (every step note from every session), the knowledge graph, the backlog, and in-flight agent state.

**What it needs:**
1. **A `worktrain talk` command** -- opens an interactive session that starts with a synthesized context bundle: recent session outcomes, open PRs, backlog top items, any findings from in-flight agents.
2. **Project memory** -- WorkTrain maintains a synthesized "project state" updated after each major session batch. Answers questions like "what did we build today?", "why did we choose polling triggers over webhooks?", "what's the biggest gap right now?"
3. **Idea capture** -- when the conversation surfaces something new, WorkTrain offers to record it to the backlog or open a GitHub issue.
4. **Context awareness** -- WorkTrain knows which agents are running, what they've found so far, and can report on it during a conversation.

**Architecture:** a `talk` workflow -- a conversational loop workflow with no fixed step count. The agent has access to `query_knowledge_graph`, `read_session_notes`, `read_backlog`, `list_in_flight_agents`, and `append_to_backlog` as tools.

**Things to hash out:**
- A conversational loop with no fixed step count could run indefinitely. What terminates a `worktrain talk` session -- user command, inactivity timeout, or a max-turns cap?
- The `append_to_backlog` tool modifies `docs/ideas/backlog.md`, which is a protected file per AGENTS.md. Is this an intentional exception for the talk workflow, or should the tool write to a separate ideas buffer?

### Automatic gap and improvement detection: proactive WorkTrain (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs knowledge graph + scheduled tasks)

WorkTrain notices things without being asked. After a batch of work lands, it scans for gaps, inconsistencies, missed connections, and improvement opportunities -- and surfaces them proactively.

**Two modes:**
1. **Event-triggered scans** -- fires after significant events (batch of PRs merge, new workflow authored, new bug filed, coordinator run completes)
2. **Periodic health checks** -- runs on a schedule (weekly): are there backlog items with prerequisites met but not started? open issues actually already fixed by merged PRs? PRs approved but not merged for more than N days? stale knowledge graph?

**Architecture:** a `watchdog` workflow that runs on a cron trigger. Queries the knowledge graph, reads recent session notes, lists open PRs and issues, reads backlog priorities, produces a `gap-report.md` with actionable findings. Each finding is either: auto-actionable (spawn a fix agent), conversation-worthy (add to ideation queue), or escalation-worthy (post to Slack/file a GitHub issue).

**The key difference from the coordinator:** the coordinator executes a known plan. The watchdog discovers things that aren't in any plan yet.

**Things to hash out:**
- The watchdog decides which findings are "auto-actionable." What safeguards prevent it from autonomously spawning sessions for things that should require human judgment?
- How does the watchdog avoid creating duplicate work if the findings it surfaces are already tracked as open issues or active sessions?
- What is the frequency trade-off for event-triggered scans? Firing after every PR merge could spawn many watchdog sessions per day on an active repo.
- The gap report is currently described as a `.md` file. Should it instead be structured data (JSON/events) that the console or coordinator can process programmatically?
- Who clears or acknowledges watchdog findings? If nobody acts on them, do they accumulate silently?

### Native multi-agent orchestration: coordinator sessions + session DAG (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: partial** | Typed primitives shipped PR #908 (Apr 30, 2026)

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Everything we can do manually today -- spawn parallel agents, chain discovery->implement->review->fix, react to findings, merge when clean -- WorkTrain should do natively, fully autonomously, with full observability.

**New primitives required:**

`spawn_session` tool (available inside workflow steps) -- starts a child session with a given workflowId + goal. Non-blocking -- returns a `sessionHandle` immediately.

`await_sessions` tool -- blocks until one or all of a set of session handles complete. Returns their results and output artifacts.

**Coordinator workflow pattern:**
```
Phase 1: Gather work items (open PRs, open issues, failing tests)
Phase 2: Spawn workers in parallel (one per work item)
Phase 3: Await all workers
Phase 4: Classify results -- clean/findings/blockers
Phase 5: Await fix agents, re-review if needed (circuit breaker: max 3 attempts)
Phase 6: Execute final action (merge sequence, create summary, post to Slack)
```

**No-user-feedback policy logic:**
- Critical/Major finding -> block merge, spawn fix agent, re-review (max 3 passes), escalate if still failing
- Minor finding -> spawn fix agent if auto-fixable, else log and proceed
- Nit -> log, proceed without fix
- Clean -> queue for merge
- Circuit breaker -> after 3 failed fix attempts, post to Slack/GitLab and pause

**Observability:** Console session tree (not flat list) showing coordinator and all children with parent-child relationships, status icons, and critical path.

**Build order:** `spawn_session` + `await_sessions` tools; parent-child session relationship in session store (`parentSessionId` field); Console DAG view for session tree; coordinator workflow templates.

**Things to hash out:**
- `spawn_session` inside a workflow step means the engine must support async child session lifecycle management. Does the engine orchestrate this, or is it the daemon's responsibility?
- If a child session fails, does the coordinator session receive the failure as a return value or as an exception? What is the Result type shape for `await_sessions`?
- How does the console DAG view handle a coordinator with 10+ parallel children? Is there a rendering strategy for large session trees?
- The circuit breaker (max 3 attempts) is described as a hard rule, but who configures it -- workflow author, coordinator script, or daemon policy?
- What is the relationship between `parentSessionId` in the session store and the `spawn_session` tool call? Is one derived from the other, or do they need to be kept in sync?

### Autonomous merge: WorkTrain approves and merges its own PRs after full vetting (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs proof records + verified CI integration)

After the full verification chain passes (unit tests, MR review clean, all required audits green), WorkTrain runs `gh pr review --approve && gh pr merge --squash` itself.

**The auto-merge policy (what makes it safe):**

Auto-merge allowed when ALL of:
- All required verification gates pass (defined by task classification)
- MR review: 0 Critical, 0 Major findings
- CI is green (all required checks pass)
- No `needs-human-review` label on the PR
- The PR was authored by a WorkTrain session (not a human)

Auto-merge blocked when ANY of:
- Any Critical or Major finding in any review/audit
- CI is failing
- Circuit breaker has fired (3+ fix attempts on same finding)
- `riskLevel=Critical`

Human always required for: schema changes, dependency upgrades (major version), infrastructure/CI/CD changes, changes to WorkTrain's own merge policy.

**The coordinator script merge gate:** checks the proof record before calling merge. The merge decision is deterministic. A human can always override by adding `needs-human-review`. Every auto-merge is appended to `~/.workrail/merge-log.jsonl`.

**Things to hash out:**
- WorkTrain approving its own PRs (`gh pr review --approve`) requires the authenticated user to have self-approval rights. This is explicitly denied in many enterprise Git setups. Is this a supported configuration, or is self-approval gated behind an explicit setting?
- The auto-merge policy excludes "changes to WorkTrain's own merge policy." How does this self-referential exception get enforced -- static analysis, file path check, or manual discipline?
- `merge-log.jsonl` is a critical audit record. What is its retention policy, and is it protected from accidental deletion?
- If the CI check suite includes flaky tests that are known to fail intermittently, the "CI is green" requirement could block merges indefinitely. Is there a policy for handling known-flaky tests?
- Should auto-merge be opt-in per workspace or per trigger, or is it always enabled when the policy conditions are met?

### Coordinator context injection standard: agents start informed, not discovering (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: partial** | Priority: high

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**What shipped (May 2026):**
- `WorkflowEnricher` (PR #947) -- daemon injects prior workspace session notes + git diff stat for all root sessions. This is the floor layer.
- `CoordinatorSpawnContext` typed interface (PR #954) in `src/coordinators/types.ts` -- explicit fields, no index signature. Coordinators inject typed context at dispatch time.
- `buildContextSummary()` + `PipelineRunContext` (PR #939) -- inter-phase artifact threading for FULL pipeline (discovery/shaping/coding/review).
- PR review coordinator assembles git diff + prior session notes via `ContextAssembler` before spawning review and fix sessions.

**What remains:** "Prior session findings" and "failure history" require Phase 2 MemoryStore (indexed SQLite) before they're fast enough to use at dispatch time. The assembly architecture is correct; the indexed data source is still unbuilt.

**Remaining thing to hash out:**
- Should the context format be standardized across all workflows, or is unstructured text the agent reads naturally sufficient?

### Session identity: a unit of work is one session, not many (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

A task involving discovery + design + implementation + review + re-review appears as 5 unrelated sessions in the console. The correct model: a session is a unit of work, not a workflow run.

**What's needed:**
1. `parentSessionId` optional field on `session_created` events
2. Root session as the visible identity (children are implementation details)
3. Console session tree view -- root sessions expandable to show children
4. `worktrain spawn --parent-session <id>` flag

**Why this matters:** with this, the console shows "here are my 5 units of work today" -- each telling a coherent story. Without it, users see 50 flat sessions and have to read goals to understand grouping.

**Things to hash out:**
- The "unit of work" concept is useful for coordinator-spawned sessions, but what about ad-hoc sessions started via CLI or MCP? Do those also have a unit-of-work identity, or is that concept only for coordinator-managed work?
- If a child session is retried after failure (new session ID, same `parentSessionId`), should both the failed and retried sessions appear in the tree, or only the successful one?
- How deep can the session tree go? A coordinator spawning workers that each spawn subagents could produce a 3+ level tree. Is there a depth limit?
- What happens when the root session is deleted or cleaned up but child sessions remain? Is the tree orphaned, or do children get promoted?

### Trigger-derived tool availability and knowledge configuration (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium -- design-first

**Score: 6** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:1 | Blocked: no

The trigger already declares what external system matters. A `gitlab_poll` trigger means the agent will be working on GitLab content. WorkTrain should use this declaration to automatically configure what tools and knowledge sources the agent gets.

**Idea 1 -- implicit tool availability from trigger source:** if `provider: gitlab_poll` -> agent automatically gets GitLab MCP tools. If `provider: jira_poll` -> agent gets Jira tools. The trigger source is a declaration of intent.

**Idea 2 -- trigger as knowledge configuration:**
```yaml
- id: jira-bug-fix
  provider: jira_poll
  knowledge:
    general:   [glean, confluence]
    codebase:  [github, local-kg]
    task:      [jira-ticket, related-prs]
    style:     [team-conventions, agents-md]
```

The daemon assembles a pre-packaged context bundle from these sources before the agent starts. The agent skips Phase 0 discovery entirely for the declared knowledge domains.

**Needs a design-first discovery pass** before implementation.

**Things to hash out:**
- If the trigger source implicitly provides tool availability, what happens when a `gitlab_poll` trigger dispatches a task that turns out to need GitHub tools (e.g. cross-repo work)?
- How does the knowledge configuration in the trigger interact with the workspace's AGENTS.md? If both declare knowledge sources, which takes precedence?
- "Implicit tool availability from trigger source" means the daemon configures the agent's toolset based on the trigger. This is a significant change to how tools are injected. What is the migration path for existing triggers?
- Does this add a new surface for configuration mistakes -- e.g. a trigger that misconfigures knowledge sources causing the agent to miss critical context silently?

### Rethinking the subagent loop from first principles (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium -- design-first

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:1 | Blocked: no

Step back from all assumptions. The current design assumes the LLM decides when to spawn, what to give subagents, and handles results -- inherited from Claude Code's `mcp__nested-subagent__Task`. That's not the only model, and it might not be the best one for WorkTrain.

**Problems with LLM-as-orchestrator:** LLMs are bad at orchestration decisions; context passing is lossy; subagent output competes with everything in the parent's context window; no enforcement -- the LLM can skip delegation entirely and just do the work itself.

**Alternative: workflow-declared parallelism, daemon-enforced:**
```yaml
- id: parallel-review
  type: parallel
  agents:
    - workflow: routine-correctness-review
      contextFrom: [phase-3-output, candidateFiles]
    - workflow: routine-philosophy-alignment
      contextFrom: [phase-0-output, philosophySources]
  synthesisStep: synthesize-parallel-review
```

The daemon sees this step definition, automatically spawns child sessions with specified workflows, injects declared context bundles, waits for all to complete, passes results to a synthesis step. The parent LLM never decides to spawn anything. The workflow declares the orchestration pattern. The daemon enforces it.

**The shift:** from "agent as orchestrator" to "workflow as orchestrator, daemon as executor, agent as cognitive unit."

**Needs a discovery session to explore the design space** before any implementation.

**Things to hash out:**
- "Workflow-declared parallelism, daemon-enforced" requires the workflow schema to express parallelism declaratively. What does that schema look like, and is it backward compatible with existing workflows?
- In the proposed `parallel` step type, what happens if one child session fails while others are still running? Is it abort-all, continue-remaining, or configurable?
- The parent LLM never decides to spawn in this model. But what if the workflow author wants the LLM to decide dynamically whether parallelism is warranted? Is that expressible in a declarative schema?
- The "daemon as executor" model assumes a single daemon with visibility into all child sessions. How does this work in a distributed setup (multiple daemon instances, cloud-hosted)?
- How does this proposal relate to the existing `spawn_agent` tool, which does allow the LLM to decide when to spawn? Are both models supported simultaneously, or does this replace `spawn_agent`?

### Workflow runtime adapter: one spec, two runtimes (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: low -- depends on subagent loop rethinking

**Score: 6** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:1 | Blocked: yes (needs subagent loop rethinking)

The workflow JSON is the canonical spec for what work needs to happen. A single adapter layer translates the canonical spec to runtime-specific execution plans.

**Two runtimes, one spec:**
- MCP adapter (human-in-the-loop): preserves `requireConfirmation` gates, presents `continue_workflow` tool call interface, LLM drives subagent spawning manually, maintains backward compat
- Daemon adapter (fully autonomous): removes `requireConfirmation` gates, replaces `continue_workflow` with `complete_step`, converts workflow-declared parallelism into automatic child session spawning

**Why this matters:** workflow improvements automatically benefit both runtimes. No dual maintenance, no parallel workflow files.

**Also eliminates "autonomous workflow variants":** the canonical workflow spec is the only version -- the daemon adapter handles what "autonomy: full" means in practice.

**Dependencies:** requires the subagent loop rethinking to be resolved first.

**Things to hash out:**
- The MCP adapter preserves `requireConfirmation` gates. The daemon adapter removes them. If a workflow is tested in one runtime context, how does the author verify it behaves correctly in the other?
- "Replaces `continue_workflow` with `complete_step`" implies a semantic difference between the two runtimes. Are there workflow patterns where this substitution changes behavior in ways the author must account for?
- Eliminating autonomous workflow variants simplifies the library, but authors currently write daemon variants for a reason. What are the cases where the adapter approach cannot replace a dedicated variant?
- Who owns the adapter implementations -- the WorkRail engine team, or workflow authors? If an adapter has a bug, every workflow using that runtime is affected.

### General-purpose workflow / intelligent dispatcher

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Two related ideas:

**`wr.quick-task`** -- the simplest possible workflow. 2 steps: do the work, call complete_step. No complexity routing, no design review, no phased implementation. For tasks under ~10 minutes. Currently small tasks go through `wr.coding-task`'s Small fast-path which is still heavier than needed.

**`wr.dispatch`** -- an intelligent routing workflow. Given a goal, classify it and route to the right workflow: `wr.quick-task` | `wr.research` | `wr.coding-task` | `wr.mr-review` | `wr.competitive-analysis`. The general-purpose entry point -- not a workflow that does everything, but one that decides which workflow to use. The adaptive pipeline coordinator already does this for the queue-poll trigger; the question is whether to expose it as a named user-facing workflow.

Open questions: does `wr.dispatch` replace `workflowId` in trigger config, or coexist alongside it? How does it handle tasks that don't fit any known workflow?

**Things to hash out:**
- How does `wr.dispatch` classify incoming goals accurately enough to route correctly? Classification errors could silently run the wrong workflow on real tasks.
- If `wr.dispatch` is the entry point for all triggers, a classification failure blocks all work. Is there a safe fallback workflow for unclassified tasks?
- Should `wr.dispatch` be visible to users as a selectable workflow in `list_workflows`, or is it infrastructure that only the coordinator and trigger config use?
- `wr.quick-task` deliberately skips review and design gates. Who is responsible for ensuring it is only used for tasks where skipping those gates is safe?
- How does `wr.dispatch` handle tasks that could fit multiple workflows (e.g. "investigate and fix this bug" spans `wr.bug-investigation` and `wr.coding-task`)?

### worktrain review <pr-number>: one-off PR review CLI command (May 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:3 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

There is no simple way to trigger a review of a specific PR without either setting up polling triggers or hand-crafting a JSON webhook payload with the branch name, PR number, and URL manually. This is too much friction for ad-hoc reviews.

**The fix:** `worktrain review <pr-number>` -- a CLI command that:
1. Calls `gh pr view <pr-number> --json number,title,headRefName,url,baseRefName` to fetch PR metadata
2. Constructs the correct `WorkflowTrigger` with all required context fields (`itemNumber`, `itemUrl`, `prBranch`) already populated
3. Dispatches `wr.mr-review` (or the workflow selected by `routeReviewWorkflow()`) via `TriggerRouter.dispatch()` with `branchStrategy: 'read-only'`
4. If `reviewerIdentity` is configured in `~/.workrail/config.json`, creates the draft review and starts the poller automatically
5. Prints a link to the WorkTrain Console session so the operator can watch progress

**Optional flags:**
- `--workflow wr.production-readiness-audit` -- override workflow selection
- `--no-draft` -- run the review but don't create a GitHub draft (just log findings to the console)
- `--repo owner/repo` -- specify repo explicitly (default: current directory's git remote)

**Why this matters:** the polling triggers handle the automated case (assigned PRs fire automatically), but operators need a simple way to say "review this PR right now" for ad-hoc cases -- PRs not assigned to them, PRs they want a second pass on, or just testing the review pipeline. A single command with no config required (besides having the daemon running) is the right UX.

**Implementation:** new `src/cli/commands/worktrain-review.ts` following the same pattern as `worktrain-spawn.ts`. Uses `gh pr view` via `execFile` for PR metadata, then calls into the daemon dispatch path.

**Things to hash out:**
- Should this require the daemon to be running, or should it spin up a one-shot session directly? Running through the daemon is cleaner (uses the full pipeline including sidecar write and poller) but requires the daemon. A direct `runWorkflow()` call without the daemon is simpler for scripts. Proposal: daemon-required for the full feature (draft review, poller); add a `--standalone` flag for environments without a running daemon.
- When `reviewerIdentity` is not configured, should `--no-draft` be the implicit default, or should the command error out asking you to configure it?

### Self-review before merge: WorkTrain runs review families on its own PRs and fixes blocking findings (May 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 15** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:3 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

When WorkTrain opens a PR through the autonomous pipeline, it currently hands off immediately after `gh pr create`. A human reviewer is then expected to catch issues. This breaks the self-improvement loop: WorkTrain's coding quality is only as good as the review bar it applies to others, and right now it doesn't apply that bar to itself before shipping.

**The fix:** after creating a PR, the coordinator runs the same review workflows (via `spawn_agent`) on WorkTrain's own output before considering the task done. If findings are `clean` or `minor` with no blockers, the PR is considered shippable. If findings are `blocking`, WorkTrain spawns a fix session, applies the changes to the same worktree branch, pushes the amendment, and re-reviews. This loop continues until findings are clean or a configured retry limit is hit, at which case it escalates to the operator outbox.

**Why this is different from the reviewer-assigned feature:** the reviewer feature posts findings as draft comments under the operator's identity for human PRs. This feature fixes findings autonomously on WorkTrain's own PRs -- no posting, no approval gate, just code changes. The output is a clean PR, not a review comment.

**Already partially implemented:** the adaptive pipeline coordinator already has a review phase and a fix-iteration loop in `full-pipeline.ts`. What's missing is (a) routing the review findings back into the worktree rather than creating a new branch, and (b) running the full review family (prod audit, arch audit, mr-review) not just `wr.mr-review`.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the right retry cap before escalating? Two fix iterations seems right -- if the coding agent can't fix blocking findings in two attempts, a human needs to look.
- Should the fix sessions run in the same worktree as the coding session, or a fresh worktree branched from the PR branch? Same worktree is simpler; fresh worktree is cleaner if the fix touches many files.
- How does WorkTrain distinguish a pre-existing issue on main from a regression it introduced? The diff is the boundary: only findings anchored to changed lines are WorkTrain's responsibility to fix. Pre-existing issues in unchanged code get filed as backlog items, not fixed in this PR.
- What happens to the fix commits in the PR history? They should be squashable -- the PR should tell the story of the feature, not the internal review-fix iterations.

### PR lifecycle management: babysit any PR from open to merged (May 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 14** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:3 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Everything between "PR opened" and "PR merged" is currently invisible to WorkTrain. CI fails silently. Reviewers request changes and nobody responds. The PR goes stale. A rebase conflict appears and blocks merge. Even for PRs WorkTrain opens autonomously, a human has to watch and intervene.

This entry covers the full lifecycle management capability -- for both WorkTrain-created PRs and any PR the operator explicitly asks WorkTrain to babysit.

**Scope:**

1. **CI failure handling**: poll CI status on open PRs. On failure, read the failing job logs, determine root cause, spawn a fix session, push to the PR branch, re-trigger CI. If the failure is flaky (same test fails intermittently with no code change), flag it as infrastructure noise rather than a code problem.

2. **Reviewer comment resolution**: poll for new review comments on the PR. Classify each comment: (a) actionable change requested → spawn fix session, apply, push, reply "Done"; (b) question or discussion → draft a response for operator approval before posting; (c) nitpick / style → apply automatically if it's a clear single-line fix, otherwise defer to operator. Never post responses autonomously without operator approval for non-trivial content.

3. **Rebase on conflict**: when the PR branch falls behind main and has merge conflicts, fetch main, rebase, resolve conflicts deterministically where possible (ours vs. theirs based on context), push force-with-lease. If conflicts are non-trivial, flag for operator.

4. **Re-review requests**: after pushing fixes, re-request review from the original reviewers so they know the PR is ready for another look.

5. **Stale PR detection**: if a PR has been open for N days with no activity from reviewers, ping the reviewer(s) or escalate to the operator outbox.

6. **Non-WorkTrain PRs**: the operator can assign WorkTrain to any PR (via reviewer assignment, a comment trigger like `/worktrain babysit`, or explicit dispatch) and WorkTrain takes over lifecycle management from that point.

**Trigger mechanism:** a `github_prs_poll` trigger with `authorLogin` filter (the operator or WorkTrain's bot account) scoped to the operator's repos. WorkTrain polls for PRs in states that need action (CI failing, changes requested, behind main, review overdue) and dispatches a lifecycle management session for each.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the right polling interval for lifecycle management vs. review? CI failure is time-sensitive (minutes); stale PR detection is not (hours). Different intervals per event type.
- Responding to reviewer comments requires posting as the operator -- same `reviewerIdentity` mechanism as the draft review feature. No posting without approval for substantive responses.
- For flaky CI: how many consecutive failures on the same test across different commits before WorkTrain declares it infrastructure noise vs. a real regression?
- Force-push for rebases requires `--force-with-lease` and a CI re-trigger. Should WorkTrain do this autonomously or always request operator approval first? Proposal: autonomous for clean rebases (no conflicts); operator approval required for conflict resolution.
- What is the right retry limit for the CI fix loop before escalating? Three attempts seems right -- if WorkTrain can't fix a CI failure in three tries, a human needs to look.

### Multi-workflow reviewer: route PRs to prod audit, arch audit, or mr-review based on context (May 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 14** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:3 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The reviewer-assigned MR review feature currently hardcodes `wr.mr-review` as the review workflow. But `wr.production-readiness-audit` and `wr.architecture-scalability-audit` exist and are suited to different kinds of PRs. A dependency bump needs a different lens than a core engine change. A PR touching the daemon's session lock needs different scrutiny than a documentation update.

**The opportunity:** when a PR is assigned to you, WorkTrain should choose the right workflow (or combination) based on what the PR actually changes -- not always run the same generalist review. Deeper, more targeted findings with less noise.

**Routing signals (static, zero LLM turns -- same principle as `routeTask()` in the adaptive pipeline):**
- `wr.production-readiness-audit`: PRs touching runtime paths -- daemon, trigger system, agent loop, session store, delivery pipeline. High blast radius if broken.
- `wr.architecture-scalability-audit`: PRs changing interfaces, type contracts, module boundaries, or core domain types.
- `wr.mr-review`: general correctness, completeness vs. requirements, test coverage. The default fallback and the only one that checks "was the right thing implemented?"
- Multiple workflows: large PRs touching multiple concerns -- run in parallel, merge findings into one `wr.review_verdict`, organize the draft review body by workflow.
- Skip / lightweight: dependency bumps, docs-only, chore commits -- no draft review created, or a one-line summary comment only.

**Implementation shape:**
- New optional `reviewWorkflowId` field on `TriggerDefinition` -- explicit per-trigger override. When absent, the router auto-selects.
- New `routeReviewWorkflow(pr, trigger): string[]` pure function (in `src/coordinators/routing/`) that maps PR metadata to one or more workflow IDs via file path patterns and diff shape. No LLM.
- When multiple workflows are selected, each runs as a parallel `spawn_agent` child under a thin coordinator session that merges findings into a single `wr.review_verdict`.
- Draft review body is organized by workflow: "**Production readiness** (3 findings) ... **Architecture** (1 finding)..."

**Things to hash out:**
- What file path patterns cleanly identify runtime vs. interface vs. general? `src/daemon/`, `src/v2/durable-core/` for runtime; `src/*/types.ts`, `src/v2/ports/` for interfaces. Worth auditing the codebase to validate coverage before shipping.
- When multiple workflows run in parallel and produce conflicting severity assessments, how are they merged? Proposal: highest severity wins at the `wr.review_verdict` level; all individual findings are surfaced in the draft body.
- For the skip/lightweight case, should WorkTrain post "no findings" as a draft review (so the author sees acknowledgment) or skip posting entirely? Skipping is less noisy.
- Should the routing decision be visible to the operator? Yes -- log it as a `review_workflow_routed` signal so the operator can see why `wr.production-readiness-audit` was chosen.

### Automated reviewer-assigned MR review with identity-matched comments (May 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 14** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:3 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

When a user is assigned as reviewer on a GitLab (or GitHub) MR, WorkTrain should automatically trigger a review session, post an acknowledgment comment in the user's voice while the review is in progress, then post the completed review in the user's comment style.

**What this looks like end-to-end:**
1. GitLab webhook or polling detects `reviewer_assigned` event for the configured user on a configured set of repos
2. WorkTrain immediately posts an acknowledgment comment (configurable template, e.g. "Taking a look at this, will have feedback shortly") so the author knows review is in progress
3. WorkTrain runs `wr.mr-review` (or the improved successor) to produce findings
4. WorkTrain posts the review findings as inline + summary comments in the user's voice -- comment style, tone, and framing should match the user's historical review patterns
5. Optionally, the user can approve/reject the posted draft before it goes live (Slack interaction, similar to what etienne-clone already implements)

**Relevant prior work:**
- `~/git/personal/etienne-clone` -- a MR review bot with GitLab posting, identity doc loading, WorkRail integration, Slack approval pipeline, and a review queue. Does NOT yet have reviewer-assignment detection (only manual `/review` endpoint trigger). The identity prompting (`src/identity/`) and GitLab posting (`src/gitlab/posting.ts`) infrastructure is directly applicable.
- `wr.mr-review-workflow.agentic.v2.json` -- the current review workflow. Needs the quality overhaul (see item below) before this can produce review-quality output worth posting.

**Things to hash out:**
- Webhook vs polling: GitLab webhooks require infrastructure. Polling `GET /merge_requests?reviewer_username=etienneb&state=opened` on a 5-minute cycle is simpler and sufficient for non-latency-sensitive reviews.
- Which repos to watch: needs a `repos` config in triggers.yml or a new trigger type.
- Acknowledgment comment: should be configurable per-repo. Some teams find bot acknowledgments noisy; others find them useful. Default on with opt-out.
- Identity matching: etienne-clone loads identity docs from `docs/`. WorkTrain needs a way to reference that same source or an equivalent -- either a path config, or the user's Memory MCP contains their review style.
- Draft approval gate: optional Slack (or operator outbox) approval step before posting. etienne-clone already has this via `createSlackInteraction`. Could reuse or port the pattern.
- Handling non-code reviews (design docs, RFCs): the review workflow is code-diff-oriented. A separate path may be needed for non-code MRs.

### wr.mr-review quality and architecture overhaul (May 8, 2026)

**Status: done** | Shipped as v2.9.0 in PR #1033 (May 18, 2026)

**Score: 13** | Cor:3 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The current `wr.mr-review` workflow produces findings that are often shallow, miss real issues present in the diff, and conflate pre-existing problems with changes introduced by the PR. In practice, reviews have missed incomplete migrations, attributed failures to the wrong root cause, and approved PRs with silent regressions in the commit history. The workflow runs as a single long-lived session reading the full diff in one pass, which limits how deeply any single concern can be investigated.

The core gap: the review workflow does not spawn focused sub-agents to investigate suspicious areas. A reviewer that spots a potentially incomplete migration should be able to spawn a quick agent to grep the codebase for other sites that were not updated -- rather than noting it as a surface observation and moving on. Without targeted investigation, the review is pattern-matching on the diff rather than reasoning about system-wide impact.

**Things to hash out:**
- What should trigger spawning a sub-agent during review -- explicit workflow step, or reviewer judgment via `spawn_agent`?
- Should sub-agents have narrow scope (e.g. "find all remaining `sessionId: string` in `src/daemon/`") or full workspace access?
- How does the parent session synthesize sub-agent findings into the final verdict? What happens if a sub-agent returns inconclusive results?
- What is the right decomposition of review concerns -- by file, by concern type, or by risk level?
- How does the review workflow distinguish "pre-existing issue on main" from "regression introduced by this PR"?
- What does a measurable acceptance criterion look like -- false negative rate, human reviewer agreement, or something else?

### MR review session count inflation

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

A single PR review dispatches 6-12 autonomous sessions (one per reviewer family: correctness_invariants, runtime_production_risk, missed_issue_hunter, etc.). This inflates session counts, complicates cost attribution, and makes ROI calculations imprecise. Worth investigating: are all 6 families catching distinct issues, or is there significant overlap? Should families be parallelized into a single session with sub-agents rather than separate top-level sessions?

**Things to hash out:**
- Is the session count problem a UX/display problem (fixable by grouping under a parent session) or an actual cost and resource problem that requires consolidation?
- If families are merged into a single session, does the LLM context window reliably hold all review dimensions simultaneously without degrading quality on any single dimension?
- What data exists to measure overlap between reviewer families? Before consolidating, verify with empirical data which families have the most redundant findings.
- If families run as sub-agents in a single session, what is the failure mode when one sub-agent's findings are poor? Does it contaminate the overall review verdict?

### Standup status generator

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

A workflow that aggregates activity across git history, GitLab/GitHub MRs and reviews, and Jira ticket transitions since the last standup. Outputs a categorized ("what I did / doing today / blockers") human-readable message. Tool-agnostic: detect available integrations and adapt.

**Things to hash out:**
- "Since the last standup" requires knowing when the last standup was. How is that derived -- calendar, fixed schedule, explicit command?
- How should the workflow handle weeks where WorkTrain did mostly mechanical work (tests, chores) vs substantive features? Should it summarize at the commit level or the intent level?
- For team standup contexts, should this expose WorkTrain's work as the developer's own work, or explicitly attribute it to WorkTrain? This depends on the team's norms.
- Is the output format fixed (what I did / doing / blockers) or customizable per team format?

### Workflow effectiveness assessment and self-improvement proposals

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

**Idea:** WorkTrain runs workflows hundreds of times. It should use that data to propose improvements.

**Per-run metrics to collect:**
- Steps skipped most often (candidate for removal)
- Steps consuming the most tokens/time
- Steps where the agent calls `continue_workflow` immediately (prompt too vague or redundant)
- Sessions that produced PRs with Critical findings (workflow not thorough enough)
- Sessions that completed vs hit max_turns

**Output:** Structured proposal per workflow:
- Step-level issues with evidence (specific sessions, specific steps)
- Proposed changes with confidence and impact estimate
- Feed directly into `workflow-for-workflows`

**Flow-back:** Low-confidence proposals as GitHub issues. High-confidence, low-risk proposals auto-applied to local copy + PR to community.

**Things to hash out:**
- How is a workflow improvement proposal validated before auto-application? A regression in a bundled workflow affects all users. Is test passage sufficient, or does it require human review?
- "High-confidence, low-risk proposals auto-applied" -- what defines low-risk? Prompt text changes are hard to classify by risk level automatically.
- Who owns the community PR process for workflow improvements? Auto-opened PRs against a community repo need a reviewer.
- If the same workflow is run with different models (Haiku vs Sonnet), the metrics will differ significantly. Are model-specific stats tracked separately or averaged?
- How does this prevent a positive feedback loop where the assessment workflow optimizes for metrics (fewer turns, faster completion) at the expense of quality?

### Ephemeral per-turn context injection in the agent loop (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The agent loop injects content (rules, soul, workspace context) into the system prompt once at session start. This means rules and behavioral constraints consume tokens for the entire session history. For long-running sessions, this is wasteful: every LLM API call re-sends the full system prompt including rules that were injected 50 turns ago. The alternative -- injecting rules on every turn as a fresh user or system message -- keeps them current but pollutes the conversation history with repetitive injections that further inflate context. There is no mechanism to inject content that is "always fresh, never historical" -- present on every loop iteration but not accumulated in the turn-by-turn conversation log.

The desired behavior: certain content (rules, behavioral constraints, workspace context, soul principles) should be re-injected on every turn as an ephemeral "floating system message" that is visible to the LLM during inference but not stored in the conversation history. The LLM always sees it but it never grows the history.

**Things to hash out:**
- Does the Anthropic API (or other LLM providers) support a distinct ephemeral/volatile content slot that is not part of the messages array? If not, what is the closest approximation?
- Is this a system prompt update per turn, or a separate "ephemeral context" message type? The distinction affects how context windows are managed by the provider.
- Should ephemeral content be declared in the workflow (as a `volatileContext` field) or injected by the daemon's buildSystemPrompt() at the infrastructure level?
- Which content actually benefits from this -- rules/soul only, or also things like "current git status", "last test run output", workspace context that may change mid-session?
- Does this interact with the WorkRail engine's `continue_workflow` step injection? Step prompts are already injected per turn via `steer()` -- is this just a generalization of that mechanism?

### Unified daemon control plane: consolidate trigger listener and console into one HTTP server (May 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain currently runs two separate HTTP servers per daemon instance: the trigger listener on port 3200 (webhooks, session steer) and the console on port 3456 (read-only session/worktree data, plus `/api/v2/auto/dispatch` bolted on). This means `worktrain dispatch` requires `worktrain console` to be running alongside the daemon, `worktrain console` cannot dispatch sessions when run standalone, and there is no single operator-facing control plane. The dispatch endpoint on the console is marked "LOCAL DEVELOPER USE ONLY" with a security TODO, which is a signal it was added to the wrong server.

The right architecture is one HTTP server per daemon instance -- the trigger listener on port 3200 -- serving everything the operator and CLI need: webhooks, session steer, operator dispatch, session state queries, worktree state, trigger list, and health. The console becomes a pure frontend that reads from this one server. `worktrain dispatch`, `worktrain logs`, and all other CLI commands talk to port 3200 only. `worktrain console` opens the browser UI pointing at the same port.

This would let `npm run dev:daemon` give a fully functional WorkTrain instance with one process and one port instead of requiring a second terminal for `worktrain console`.

**Things to hash out:**
- Does the console frontend need CORS changes when served from the same port as the API?
- What happens to the standalone `worktrain console` command for users who don't have the daemon running -- does it still work as a read-only view of the session store?
- Should the migration be incremental (mount console routes on the trigger listener in addition to the console server) or a clean cutover?

### Operator-facing capability toggles: named, discoverable WorkTrain behaviors (May 20, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 11** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

There is no operator-facing concept of "what WorkTrain does." To enable autonomous PR review, an operator must write a `github_prs_poll` trigger with the right provider, workflowId, branchStrategy, delivery config, and agent config -- 15+ lines of YAML requiring deep knowledge of WorkTrain internals. There is no way to look at a config and understand at a human level what behaviors are active. Operators cannot discover what WorkTrain is capable of, only configure it from scratch.

The idea: a `capabilities.yml` or `capabilities:` section in config declares named, toggleable behaviors. Each capability is a pre-configured, opinionated behavior that just works when enabled. Examples: `pr_review` (automatically reviews open PRs assigned to a reviewer), `queue_processor` (picks up tickets assigned to WorkTrain from GitHub), `dependency_bumps` (auto-reviews and merges clean dependabot PRs), `self_improvement` (runs WorkTrain on WorkTrain's own issue queue). The capabilities layer generates the underlying triggers -- operators never write trigger YAML unless they need fine-grained control.

This makes WorkTrain feel like a product rather than a framework. An operator starting fresh can enable `pr_review: true` and have it work without reading documentation about polling providers, delivery adapters, or branch strategies.

**Key design question:** Is this a config-generation layer (capabilities compile down to triggers.yml at daemon start) or a replacement for triggers.yml (capabilities ARE the configuration, triggers are an implementation detail)? The first is backward compatible and lower risk; the second is the cleaner long-term UX. A discovery session is needed before implementation.

**Things to hash out:**
- Where does capability config live -- `~/.workrail/capabilities.yml`, a section in `config.json`, or alongside triggers.yml in the workspace?
- How do capabilities interact with existing hand-written triggers -- do they coexist, override, or merge?
- What is the right set of first-party capabilities to ship? PR review and queue processor are clear; what else is there?
- Should capabilities expose the same configuration knobs as triggers (model, timeouts, branch strategy), or hide them entirely with sensible defaults?
- Does `worktrain init` become the entry point for enabling capabilities, replacing manual trigger authoring?

## Platform Vision (longer-term)

### Epic-mode: full autonomous delivery of a multi-task feature from discovery to merged PRs (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:1 | Blocked: yes (blocked by: living work context, coordinator pipeline operational end-to-end, spawn_agent depth + parallel worktree support)

Today WorkTrain handles one ticket at a time. An epic -- a feature that requires 5-10 interdependent changes across multiple files, modules, or services -- requires the operator to manually decompose it into tickets and dispatch each one separately. The decomposition, dependency ordering, and integration are all human work. This is the gap between "WorkTrain handles tickets" and "WorkTrain handles features."

The idea: a single operator action kicks off an end-to-end autonomous pipeline for an entire epic. A planning phase fully decomposes the epic into a dependency-ordered task graph. Each task is a concrete, independently-implementable unit of work. Dependent tasks wait for their predecessors to land. Independent tasks are dispatched simultaneously to parallel agents in separate worktrees. Each task produces a PR. PRs target each other in a chain (each PR's base branch is the previous task's feature branch, or a shared integration branch). A coordinator monitors progress, re-plans when a task produces unexpected output, and handles failures by re-dispatching or escalating. When all tasks are merged (in dependency order), the epic is done.

This is the feature that makes WorkTrain feel like it can take on real engineering work, not just isolated bug fixes and small features.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the planning artifact? The decomposition step needs to produce a typed task graph -- not just a list of tasks, but explicit dependency edges, estimated scope per task, and the integration strategy (shared branch, stacked PRs, merge train). What schema captures this in a way the coordinator can route on deterministically?
- How are dependencies enforced? If task B depends on task A, does B's agent start only after A's PR is merged, or does it work against A's branch before merge? The latter is faster but requires the coordinator to handle A's branch being rebased or amended.
- How does the coordinator handle a task whose output invalidates the plan? If task A's implementation reveals a constraint that makes task C unnecessary or changes its scope, the coordinator needs to re-plan. What signals task A to the coordinator, and what does re-planning look like? Does it spawn a new planning agent, or does the coordinator apply deterministic rules?
- What is the integration strategy for parallel tasks that touch overlapping files? Two agents working in separate worktrees may produce conflicting changes. Is this detected at PR-open time (merge conflicts), at plan time (the planner tries to assign non-overlapping scopes), or both?
- What is the failure model? If one task in a 10-task epic fails after 3 tasks have merged, what happens to the already-landed work? The coordinator can't un-merge. Does it escalate to the operator, attempt a compensating task, or leave the partial state as-is?
- How does this interact with the living work context design? Each task agent needs context from the planning phase (what the epic is trying to accomplish, what other tasks are doing, what invariants the whole feature must satisfy). This is exactly the cross-session context problem but at epic scale -- the context store needs to accumulate across a task graph, not just a linear pipeline.
- What is the operator experience? Does the operator see a dashboard of all tasks in flight, their dependencies, and their status? Can they pause the epic, re-scope a task, or cancel a branch of the task graph mid-execution?

**Why it's high leverage despite low confidence:** getting this right makes WorkTrain the tool for large-scale autonomous development. Every other item in the backlog improves WorkTrain's reliability or quality for one ticket. This item changes the unit of work from "ticket" to "feature."

### Move backlog to a dedicated worktrain-meta repo with version control (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 11** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The backlog (`docs/ideas/backlog.md`) lives in the code repo. Every feature branch has its own version. Ideas added mid-session on a feature branch are held hostage until that PR merges. If two branches modify the backlog simultaneously, merge conflicts occur. There is no single authoritative place to capture an idea that immediately applies everywhere.

A dedicated `worktrain-meta` repo (e.g. `~/git/personal/worktrain-meta/`) would hold the backlog as the only concern. No feature branches -- ideas are committed directly to main. Full git history preserved. No code PR ever touches it.

Done means: an operator or agent can add a backlog idea from any branch or context, commit directly, and it is immediately visible on all other branches and in all other sessions.

**Note on format:** when this migration happens, one-file-per-item with YAML frontmatter becomes viable. Frontmatter makes scores, status, dates, and blocked-by machine-readable without prose parsing. The `npm run backlog` script would read frontmatter instead of regex-parsing Score lines. This is the right time to adopt that format -- in the current single-file structure frontmatter would require a custom delimiter scheme, but one-file-per-item makes it natural.

**Things to hash out:**
- Should the worktrain-meta repo also hold the roadmap docs, now-next-later, open-work-inventory? Or just the backlog?
- How do subagents spawned in a worktree find the backlog? They need a configured path, not relative to the code workspace.
- When native structured backlog operations are built (SQLite), does the storage backend live in worktrain-meta (git-tracked history) or `~/.workrail/data/` (local queryable)? Both have merit.

### Invocable routines: dispatch an existing routine directly as a task (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 12** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:3 Con:3 | Blocked: no

WorkRail has a routines system (`workflows/routines/`) for reusable workflow fragments. But routines can only be used embedded inside a larger workflow -- there is no way to invoke a routine directly as a standalone task. Many useful repeat tasks are process-shaped (same steps every time, structured output) and could be expressed as short 1-2 step workflows or existing routines. Today an operator who wants to run "context gathering" or "hypothesis challenge" on demand has to either build a wrapper workflow or do it manually.

There is no dispatch surface for standalone routine invocation. Done means: an operator can invoke any routine by name from the CLI or a trigger, and the result is durable in the session store.

**Relationship to existing ideas:** this is one half of the lightweight agents gap (the process-shaped half). The ad-hoc query half is a separate entry below.

**Things to hash out:**
- Should this be a new CLI command (`worktrain invoke <routineId> --goal "..."`) or a trigger type, or both?
- Do routines need output contracts defined before they can be invoked standalone, or is free-form output acceptable?
- How does the session store record a routine-only run vs a full workflow run? Should they be distinguished?

### Ad-hoc query agents: answer questions about the workspace without a full workflow (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 11** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs knowledge graph for efficient context)

There is a class of tasks that are question-shaped rather than process-shaped: "why does the session store use a manifest file?", "what would break if I changed this function?", "summarize what shipped this week." These don't have fixed steps, don't produce structured output contracts, and don't benefit from workflow phase gating. Running a full `wr.coding-task` session for them wastes 10 minutes on overhead. Not supporting them means the operator has to context-switch to Claude Code or do them manually.

These tasks need a capable agent with workspace context but no workflow structure. They are stateless, single-purpose, and short-lived.

Examples of what this enables:
- `worktrain ask "why does the session store use a manifest file?"`
- `worktrain explain pr/908`
- `worktrain impact src/trigger/coordinator-deps.ts`
- `worktrain diff-since "last week"`

Done means: an operator can ask a natural-language question about the workspace and get a grounded answer within seconds, without starting a full session.

**Relationship to existing ideas:** `worktrain talk` (interactive ideation) is the conversational, stateful version of this. Standup status generator is a scheduled instance of the same pattern. Invocable routines (entry above) are the process-shaped complement. This entry covers the unstructured query case.

**Things to hash out:**
- Without the knowledge graph, these queries require full file-scanning on every invocation -- too slow to be useful. Is there a minimum viable version before the KG is built, or does this wait?
- What is the boundary between "this is a quick query" and "this actually needs a full discovery session"? Who decides -- the operator, or WorkTrain itself?
- Should outputs be ephemeral (printed to terminal, not stored) or durable (in session store)? Durability adds value for audit but adds overhead.

### Self-restart after shipping changes to itself (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 11** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs self-improvement loop operational)

If WorkTrain can build and ship changes to itself autonomously, the natural next step is that it also restarts itself with those changes. Today, after a WorkTrain daemon session ships a change to the workrail repo, the daemon continues running the old binary. The operator has to manually run `worktrain daemon --stop && worktrain daemon --start` to pick up the new version. In a self-improving system running overnight, this is a human intervention point that should not exist.

**What this requires:**
1. After a session that modifies WorkTrain itself merges to main, the daemon detects it was running on this repo
2. The daemon rebuilds (`npm run build`) and restarts itself cleanly -- completing any in-flight sessions first, then performing a graceful restart with the new binary
3. After restart, the daemon logs what changed so the operator can review

This is related to the "daemon binary stale after rebuild" P0 gap, but goes further: not just warning about staleness, but actually handling the upgrade cycle automatically.

**Why this matters for the self-improvement loop:** if WorkTrain ships 5 improvements to itself in a day but the operator has to manually restart it 5 times, the loop isn't truly autonomous. Full autonomy requires the restart to be part of the pipeline.

**Things to hash out:**
- What triggers the restart check? After every merge to main that touches `src/`? After a successful `npm run build`? On a heartbeat that detects binary staleness?
- How does the daemon ensure in-flight sessions complete before restarting? Does it drain the active session set or hard-stop?
- What is the rollback path if the new binary fails to start (startup crash, broken build)? The daemon needs to detect this and either roll back or alert the operator.
- Should the restart happen immediately or at a configurable "quiet period" (e.g. 2am) to avoid disrupting active sessions during the day?
- Self-modification is inherently risky -- a buggy change to the daemon's restart logic could make the daemon unable to restart at all. What safeguards prevent this?

### WorkTrain as a first-class project participant: ideal backlog and planning capabilities (Apr 30, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high (long-term)

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:1 | Blocked: yes (needs knowledge graph + project memory layer)

Right now WorkTrain manages its backlog like a human with a text editor -- it reads a file, reasons about it, writes changes. Every session re-derives context it already derived before. There is no persistent structured understanding of the project that survives across sessions. The ideal is fundamentally different: the backlog is not a document WorkTrain edits, it is a live model of the project WorkTrain both reads and updates as a first-class participant.

The capabilities that make up the ideal:

**1. Persistent project memory**
WorkTrain accumulates understanding of the project over time -- what was tried, why things were decided, what the current trajectory is -- in a form that persists and updates incrementally across sessions. Not session notes (those already exist), but a synthesized model: "where is this project right now and where is it going?" Updated automatically as work happens, not reconstructed from scratch each time.

**2. Native structured backlog operations**
First-class tools -- `get_backlog_item(id)`, `update_score(id, scores)`, `add_item(...)`, `query_items(filter)`, `get_dependents(id)` -- rather than reading a markdown file and parsing it. The backlog is data. WorkTrain should treat it as data, not text.

**3. Dependency graph with automatic inference**
Not just manually declared `blocked_by` links, but WorkTrain inferring relationships from reading items and the codebase -- "implementing X will require Y to exist first" -- and recording those inferences persistently. The graph updates as work completes and dependencies resolve.

**4. Context-aware scoring**
Scores that understand the current moment -- what's in flight, what just shipped, what the operator is focused on -- so priority shifts as the project evolves without manual re-scoring. The rubric is not applied in isolation; it's applied against the current project state.

**5. Proactive surfacing**
WorkTrain doesn't wait to be asked "what should I work on?" It knows when a high-score unblocked item has been sitting idle too long, when a blocker just resolved making a previously-blocked item executable, or when work it just completed changes the relative priority of other items. It surfaces these unprompted.

**6. Honest self-assessment**
WorkTrain tracks its own execution history -- which item categories it completed cleanly vs got stuck on, where it overestimated confidence, which workflows it handles reliably vs which it doesn't. This history feeds back into scoring: a Correctness 3 item in a category WorkTrain consistently struggles with should score differently than one it handles well.

**7. Backlog and execution as one system**
When WorkTrain picks up an item, it is simultaneously dequeued from the backlog, tracked as in-flight, and -- on completion -- automatically marked done, dependent item scores updated, and newly-executable items surfaced. The backlog and the work queue are not separate systems maintained separately.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the persistent project memory stored as -- a structured document, a database, a knowledge graph node, or a combination? The answer determines how it's queried and updated.
- Automatic dependency inference requires reading both items and code. How does WorkTrain know when its inference is reliable vs speculative? Incorrect inferences that block work are worse than no inference at all.
- Context-aware scoring means scores are not stable -- the same item can have a different score on different days. How does the operator reason about priority if scores shift? Is there a "score as of today" vs "canonical score" distinction?
- Self-assessment requires WorkTrain to have a model of its own capabilities and failure modes. This is subtle -- how does it distinguish "I got stuck because the task was hard" from "I got stuck because I handle this category poorly"?
- Proactive surfacing risks becoming noise if WorkTrain surfaces too many things or surfaces them at the wrong moment. What is the right cadence and channel for unprompted priority signals?
- The backlog-as-data model requires a defined schema. What happens to items that don't fit the schema cleanly -- highly exploratory ideas, resolved debates, historical context that matters but isn't actionable?

### Knowledge graph for agent context

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs MemoryStore first as Phase 2 prerequisite)

**Problem:** Every session starts with a full repo sweep. Context gathering subagents re-read the same files, re-trace the same call chains, re-identify the same invariants. And cross-session semantic queries ("what did we find about this module last week") cannot be answered without a vector index.

**Position in the phased memory architecture (from Apr 30 discovery):** This is Phase 3 in a four-phase sequence. Phase 0 (bug fixes) → Phase 1 (universal enricher) → Phase 2 (MemoryStore SQLite) → Phase 3 (knowledge graph). The MemoryStore SQLite from Phase 2 answers 6 of 8 memory queries without a vector model. The knowledge graph adds the remaining two: code-structure traversal (Q8) and semantic similarity ("what is related to X"). Phase 3a (structural layer) extends the existing spike; Phase 3b (vector layer) is a feature flag.

**Design -- two-layer hybrid:**

**Layer 1: Structural graph (hard edges, deterministic) -- Phase 3a**
Extends existing `src/knowledge-graph/` spike (DuckDB + ts-morph, already in `dependencies`). New node kinds: `session`, `pipeline_run`, `workspace_convention`. New edge kinds: `produced_by` (session → file), `applies_to_workspace`. Current spike only tracks import edges and CLI commands; session data from Phase 2 MemoryStore migrates here. Answers: "what imports trigger-router.ts?", "what files did session X touch?", "what sessions ran in this workspace?"

**Layer 2: Vector similarity (soft weights, semantic) -- Phase 3b (feature flag)**
LanceDB (embedded, TypeScript-native, local-first). Embeddings over session recaps and workspace conventions. Off by default (`WORKRAIL_VECTOR_SEARCH=1` to enable). Answers: "what sessions are semantically related to this bug?", "what workspace conventions mention authentication?"

**Technology:**
- Structural: `ts-morph` + DuckDB (existing spike, already in dependencies)
- Vector: LanceDB + local embedding model -- `@xenova/transformers` (in-process, no external dep) preferred over Ollama (better quality but requires external process)
- Unified query: `query_knowledge(intent, workspacePath)` replaces `query_memory` tool when Phase 3a lands

**Build decision (from Apr 15 research):** ts-morph + DuckDB wins. Cognee: Python-only. GraphRAG/LightRAG: use LLMs to build graph (violates scripts-over-agent). Mem0/Zep: conversational memory, not code graphs. Sourcegraph: enterprise weight, overkill.

**Things to hash out:**
- Phase 3a scope: should the structural layer replace the Phase 2 SQLite MemoryStore (same data, different engine) or exist alongside it? Replacing is cleaner; coexisting avoids a migration.
- `@xenova/transformers` vs Ollama for Phase 3b: @xenova runs in-process (no setup friction) but has lower embedding quality. Ollama is better quality but adds an external process dependency. Which matters more for the target user base?
- The incremental update strategy (re-index only `filesChanged` after each session) requires accurate change tracking. What is the fallback when `filesChanged` is unavailable?
- DuckDB is in-process -- WAL mode handles read concurrency but writes are serialized. Is the concurrency story acceptable when 3 sessions complete simultaneously?
- Is the KG per-workspace or global? Per-workspace is simpler; global enables cross-workspace queries but adds federation complexity.

- Nothing -> ideation -> market research -> spec authoring -> ticket creation -> implementation
- BRD + designs -> architecture review -> implementation
- Fully specced -> coding only

**New workflows needed:**
- `classify-task-workflow` -- fast, 1-step, outputs `taskComplexity`/`riskLevel`/`hasUI`/`touchesArchitecture`/`taskMaturity`
- `ideation-workflow`, `spec-authoring-workflow`, `ticket-creation-workflow`, `grooming-workflow`

**Things to hash out:**
- How does the coordinator determine task maturity? Is this a classification workflow output, a field on the issue/ticket, or derived from artifact presence?
- When maturity is `idea`, the pipeline runs ideation + market research. These could take hours. Does the coordinator hold the queue slot during all upstream phases, or release and re-acquire?
- How are the new workflows (`ideation-workflow`, `spec-authoring-workflow`, etc.) different from `wr.discovery` and `wr.shaping`? Are these new workflows, or just renamed compositions?
- How does the pipeline composition interact with `workOnAll: true`? For a raw idea, the pipeline could autonomously run all the way to code without any human input -- is that the intended behavior?

### Per-workspace work queue

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**The insight:** Triggers make WorkTrain reactive. A work queue makes it proactive -- it pulls the next item when capacity is available, works it to completion, pulls the next.

**Internal queue:** `~/.workrail/workspaces/<name>/queue.jsonl` -- append-only, one item per line, consumed in priority order then FIFO.

**External pull sources:**
- GitHub issues (label filter)
- GitLab issues (label filter)
- Jira sprint board
- Linear triage queue

**Queue + message queue + talk:**

| Interface | Use case | Latency |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Work queue | "do this when you have capacity" | When a slot is free |
| Message queue (`worktrain tell`) | "do this now, between current sessions" | End of current batch |
| Talk (`worktrain talk`) | "let's discuss and decide together" | Interactive |

**Things to hash out:**
- How does the per-workspace internal queue (`queue.jsonl`) interact with the existing `github_queue_poll` and `gitlab_poll` triggers? Are they additive sources into the same queue, or separate systems?
- Who controls priority assignment for queue items? Is it explicit (operator assigns priority) or inferred (WorkTrain computes it)?
- What happens when the queue is empty and capacity is available -- does WorkTrain go idle or proactively seek work?
- Should the queue be inspectable and editable by the operator via CLI, or is it a fully opaque internal mechanism?
- How does per-workspace queue isolation interact with global concurrency limits? A workspace with a large queue could starve other workspaces.

### Remote references (URLs, GDocs, Confluence)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

**Design:** Extend the workflow `references` system to support remote sources (HTTP URLs, Google Docs, Confluence pages). WorkRail remains a pointer system -- it validates declarations are well-formed, delivers the pointer, and the agent fetches with its own tools. Auth is entirely delegated to the agent.

**Incremental path:**
- Phase 1: public HTTP URLs. `resolveFrom: "url"`. WorkRail delivers the URL; agent fetches. No auth surface in WorkRail.
- Phase 2: workspace-configured bearer tokens in `.workrail/config.json` keyed by domain
- Phase 3: named integrations (GDocs, Confluence, Notion) as first-class configured sources

**Design questions:**
- Should WorkRail attempt a reachability check at start time, or skip entirely for remote refs?
- How should remote refs appear in `workflowHash`? Content can change between runs.
- `kind` field (`local` vs `remote`) or infer from `source` value?

**Things to hash out:**
- Phase 2 (workspace-configured bearer tokens) puts credentials in `.workrail/config.json`. If this file is in the repo, tokens are at risk of being committed. What is the recommended credential storage model?
- The Phase 1 design (agent fetches the URL itself) means the agent has access to any URL declared in a workflow. Is there any validation or allowlist for what remote sources a workflow can reference?
- Remote document content changes between runs. Should WorkRail snapshot the content at session start for reproducibility, or always use live content?
- When a remote ref is unavailable (network error, auth failure), should the session fail, warn and continue, or fall back to a cached version?

### Declarative composition engine

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 6** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:1 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Summary:** Users or agents fill out a declarative spec (dimensions, scope, rigor level) and the WorkRail engine assembles a workflow automatically from a library of pre-validated routines. The agent is a form-filler, not an architect -- the composition logic lives in the engine.

**Why different from agent-generated workflows:** Engine-composed workflows are assembled from pre-reviewed building blocks using deterministic rules. Same spec always produces the same workflow shape.

**Good early use cases:** Audit-style workflows (user picks dimensions, engine assembles auditor steps), review workflows, investigation workflows.

**Things to hash out:**
- Who defines the "library of pre-validated routines"? How does a routine get accepted into the composition library vs remaining a workflow-specific step?
- How does the spec input interface work -- is it a YAML/JSON document, a CLI prompt sequence, or a tool call? Who calls it?
- "Same spec always produces the same workflow shape" is a strong determinism guarantee. How is this enforced when routines are updated? Does a spec locked to routine v1.2 still produce the same shape after routine v1.3 ships?
- Should the resulting workflow be persisted (so the user can inspect and modify it), or is it ephemeral (assembled fresh each run)?
- How does error handling work when the spec declares a combination of dimensions that no valid routine composition can satisfy?

### Workflow categories and category-first discovery

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 7** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Summary:** Improve workflow discovery by organizing bundled workflows into categories. Currently the catalog is large enough that flat discovery is becoming noisy.

**Phase 1 shape:** If no category is passed, return category names + workflow count per category + a few representative titles. If a category is passed, return the full workflows for that category.

**Design questions:**
- Should categories live in workflow JSON, in a registry overlay, or be inferred from directory/naming?
- Should `list_workflows` become polymorphic, or should category discovery be a separate mode?

**Things to hash out:**
- How does category assignment work for user-imported workflows? Can users assign categories, or is it only for bundled workflows?
- If a workflow fits multiple categories (e.g. a workflow that is both a "review" and an "audit"), can it appear in multiple categories, or does it have a single primary?
- Does category-first discovery change what gets returned in the existing `list_workflows` schema? Is this a backward-compatible extension or a new tool?
- Who maintains the category taxonomy as the library grows? What prevents categories from proliferating to the point they become as noisy as the flat list?

### Forever backward compatibility (workrailVersion)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

Every workflow declares `workrailVersion: "1.4.0"`. The engine maintains compatibility adapters for all previous declared versions -- old workflows run forever without author intervention. The engine adapts; authors never migrate.

**The web model:** this is how browsers handle HTML from 1995. A `<marquee>` tag still renders because the browser adapts, not because the author rewrote their page.

**Engineering implication:** permanent commitment. Once a version adapter is shipped, it cannot be removed. The tradeoff is real but the alternative (expecting external authors to track WorkRail releases and migrate) breaks the platform trust model.

**Phase 1:** Add `workrailVersion` field to schema. Default to `"1.0.0"` for existing workflows. Record in run events.
**Phase 2:** Introduce the first adapter when the first schema-breaking change is needed.
**Phase 3:** Build a compatibility test harness in CI.

**Related:** `src/v2/read-only/v1-to-v2-shim.ts` (existing precedent for version adaptation).

**Things to hash out:**
- "Once a version adapter is shipped, it cannot be removed" is a hard commitment. What is the governance process for accepting this commitment for a given version? Who signs off?
- How does `workrailVersion` interact with `schemaVersion` (the versioned schema validation idea elsewhere in this backlog)? Are these the same concept, or do they track different axes?
- If a workflow omits `workrailVersion` (the default-1.0.0 case), can WorkRail ever remove the v1.0.0 adapter? The default-to-1.0.0 mechanism means the adapter must be permanent.
- The compatibility test harness in CI must test all adapters on every release. For N historical versions, this is O(N) adapter tests. At what point does this become a maintenance burden?

### Parallel forEach execution

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Sequential `forEach` (and `for`, `while`, `until`) all work -- implemented in the v1 interpreter and the v2 durable core. The idea here is parallel execution: run all iterations concurrently rather than sequentially. Requires design around: session store concurrent writes, token protocol isolation per iteration, and console DAG rendering for parallel branches.

**Things to hash out:**
- Token protocol isolation per iteration is not trivial. Each parallel branch needs its own HMAC token chain. How does the engine mint and track N independent token chains for a single forEach step?
- What is the semantics of a failure in one parallel iteration -- abort all, continue others, or configurable?
- How are the outputs of N parallel iterations combined for the next sequential step? Is there a built-in aggregation, or is the workflow author responsible for merging?
- How does the console DAG render parallel forEach branches without becoming unreadable for large arrays (e.g. 20 items in a forEach)?
- What is the concurrency limit for parallel forEach -- is it bounded by `maxConcurrentSessions`, or is there a per-step parallelism limit?

### Assessment-gate tiers beyond v1

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 7** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Tier 1 (current):** Same-step follow-up retry. Consequence keeps the same step pending; engine returns semantic follow-up guidance.

**Tier 2 (future):** Structured redo recipe on the same step. Engine surfaces a bounded checklist. No new DAG nodes or true subflow.

**Tier 3 (future):** Assessment-triggered redo subflow. Matched consequence routes into an explicit sequence of follow-up steps. Introduces assessment-driven control-flow behavior.

**Design questions:** When does Tier 2 become necessary? What durable model would Tier 3 need for entering, progressing through, and returning from a redo subflow?

**Things to hash out:**
- Tier 3 (redo subflow) requires the engine to create new DAG nodes dynamically at runtime. What are the constraints on which steps can be the target of an assessment-triggered redo?
- How does Tier 2's "bounded checklist" differ from an existing assessment consequence in Tier 1? Is this a new execution contract, or just a richer prompt injection?
- When does Tier 2 become necessary? Before building it, is there evidence from real workflow runs that Tier 1 is insufficient for specific use cases?
- Tier 3 significantly increases engine complexity. How does it interact with existing features like `jumpIf`, `runCondition`, and loops?

### Workflow rewind / re-scope support

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Allow an in-progress session to go back to an earlier point when new information changes scope, invalidates assumptions, or reveals the current path is wrong.

**Phase 1:** Allow rewind to a prior checkpoint with an explicit reason. Record a "why we rewound" note in session history.

**Phase 2:** Scope-change prompts ("our understanding changed", "the task is broader/narrower"). Let workflows declare safe rewind points explicitly.

**Design questions:**
- Should rewind be limited to explicit checkpoints, or support arbitrary node-level rewind?
- How should the system preserve notes from abandoned paths?
- Should some steps be marked non-rewindable once external side effects have happened?

**Things to hash out:**
- Who can initiate a rewind -- the agent, a human operator, or the coordinator? Are there different constraints for each initiator?
- If a rewind discards steps that made external side effects (e.g. a git push, a PR comment), the side effects remain but the session state rolls back. How is this inconsistency surfaced?
- What is the maximum rewind distance? Allowing arbitrary node-level rewind on a 30-step workflow could create very confusing session histories.
- How does rewind interact with the HMAC token protocol? Tokens are forward-only by design -- can a rewound session re-issue tokens for already-advanced steps?

### Subagent composition chains

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Native support for nested subagents -- an agent spawning a subagent, which spawns its own -- up to a configurable depth limit.

```yaml
agentDefaults:
  maxSubagentDepth: 3
  maxTotalAgentsPerTask: 10
```

**Depth semantics:** Coordinator=0, worker=1, subagent=2, sub-subagent=3.

`maxTotalAgentsPerTask` prevents exponential explosion: depth-3 tree with 3 agents per node = 27 concurrent agents without this cap.

**Things to hash out:**
- How does the depth counter propagate through `spawn_session` calls? Is it tracked in the session event log, or in-memory in the daemon?
- If a sub-subagent is killed (timeout, crash), does it count against the depth and total counts of its parent session? How are orphaned depth slots reclaimed?
- `maxTotalAgentsPerTask` requires a shared counter across all agents in a chain. What is the concurrency-safe mechanism for this counter -- is it in the session store, a daemon in-memory structure, or something else?
- Should composition chains be opt-in per workflow/trigger, or available to any workflow by default?

### Mobile monitoring and remote access

**Status: idea** | Priority: low (post-daemon-MVP)

**Score: 6** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:1 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Goal:** Control and monitor autonomous WorkRail sessions from a phone.

**What's needed:**
1. Mobile-responsive console with touch-friendly layout and tap to pause/resume/cancel
2. Push notifications (via Slack/Telegram webhook -- no native app required for MVP)
3. Human-in-the-loop approval on mobile -- maps to `POST /api/v2/sessions/:id/resume`
4. Session log view -- linear timeline, not DAG

**Things to hash out:**
- Remote access requires the console to be reachable from outside the local network. What is the default security model -- is unauthenticated remote access acceptable for a tool managing autonomous code changes?
- Push notifications via webhook require a persistent endpoint (Slack/Telegram bot). Who sets this up -- WorkTrain automates it, or the operator configures it manually?
- "Tap to pause/resume/cancel" is write access from a mobile client. What authentication and authorization model protects these actions from unauthorized access?
- Should mobile monitoring be opt-in or default-on? Users who haven't configured remote access should not inadvertently expose their console.

**Remote access options:**
1. `workrail tunnel` command (Cloudflare Tunnel from the laptop) -- works behind any NAT/VPN
2. Tailscale integration -- zero WorkRail code needed
3. Cloud session sync -- daemon pushes events to S3/R2

**Priority:** Post-daemon-MVP. Design the REST control plane with mobile in mind from the start.

### WorkRail Auto: cloud-hosted autonomous platform

**Status: idea** | Priority: long-term

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs proven local daemon)

**Goal:** WorkRail Auto runs on a server 24/7, connected to your engineering ecosystem, working autonomously without a laptop open.

**What this enables:** GitLab MR opened -> WorkRail reviews, posts comment. Jira ticket moves to In Progress -> WorkRail starts coding task, pushes branch. PagerDuty fires -> WorkRail runs investigation, posts findings to Slack.

**Architecture implications:**
- Multi-tenancy: isolated session stores, isolated credential vaults per org
- Horizontal scaling: multiple daemon instances consuming from a shared trigger queue
- Rate limiting per org, per integration

**Relationship to self-hosted:** Self-hosted is always free, always open source, always works offline. WorkRail Auto is the natural SaaS layer -- same engine, same workflows, managed infrastructure.

**Priority:** Long-term. Design the local daemon with multi-tenancy seams in mind from the start (don't hardcode single-user assumptions). Don't build the hosted layer until the local daemon is proven.

**Things to hash out:**
- What is the business model for WorkRail Auto -- per-seat, per-org, usage-based (tokens consumed), or outcome-based?
- Multi-tenancy requires credential isolation between orgs. What is the threat model -- can a compromised tenant access another tenant's code or credentials?
- The "same engine, same workflows" promise requires the cloud version to stay in sync with the open-source version. What is the release cadence and sync mechanism?
- Horizontal scaling with multiple daemon instances requires a shared trigger queue. What is the queue technology (Redis, Postgres, SQS)? This is a significant infrastructure dependency to introduce.
- When does the decision to build the hosted layer get made? What are the criteria ("local daemon is proven" needs a concrete definition)?

### Multi-project WorkTrain

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium (to investigate)

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Problem:** WorkTrain needs to handle multiple completely unrelated projects simultaneously, but some projects are related and need to share knowledge.

**Proposed model:** Workspace namespacing with explicit cross-workspace links:
```yaml
workspaces:
  workrail:
    path: ~/git/personal/workrail
    knowledgeGraph: ~/.workrail/graphs/workrail.db
    maxConcurrentSessions: 3
    relatedWorkspaces: [storyforge]
  storyforge:
    path: ~/git/personal/storyforge
    knowledgeGraph: ~/.workrail/graphs/storyforge.db
    relatedWorkspaces: [workrail]
```

**Must be workspace-scoped:** knowledge graph, daemon-soul.md, session store, concurrency limits, triggers.

**Can be shared globally:** WorkTrain binary, token usage tracking, message queue, merge audit log.

**Things to hash out:**
- How does a workspace know about `relatedWorkspaces` in practice? Is this purely advisory metadata for human context, or does WorkTrain actively query related workspace KGs during sessions?
- If two related workspaces have conflicting behavioral rules in their respective `daemon-soul.md` files, what is the priority when a cross-workspace session runs?
- Is the workspace config (`~/.workrail/workspaces`) stored in the user's home directory or per-repo? If per-repo, what happens for repos shared across users or machines?
- What is the migration path for existing single-workspace setups? Does adding workspace namespacing require changes to all existing config files?
- Global shared items (token usage, message queue, merge audit log) need to remain consistent across workspaces. Who is responsible for multi-workspace consistency in these shared files?

### Message queue: async communication with WorkTrain from anywhere

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

**Design:** A persistent message queue (`~/.workrail/message-queue.jsonl`) that decouples when you send a message from when WorkTrain acts on it.

```bash
worktrain tell "skip the architecture review for the polling triggers PR, it's low risk"
worktrain tell "add knowledge graph vector layer to next sprint"
```

Each command appends to the queue. The daemon drains between agent completions -- never mid-run, always at a natural break point.

**Outbox (WorkTrain -> user):** WorkTrain appends notifications to `~/.workrail/outbox.jsonl`. A mobile client polls this or an HTTP SSE endpoint wraps it.

**This is the foundation for mobile monitoring.** The mobile app is just a client that reads outbox and writes to message-queue.

**Things to hash out:**
- Messages in the queue are natural language instructions. How does the daemon interpret and act on them reliably? Is there a classification step, or is the message passed directly to an LLM for interpretation?
- What prevents a malicious or accidental message from authorizing dangerous actions ("merge all PRs" or "delete the worktree")? Is there a permission model for message queue instructions?
- "Drained between agent completions" means messages could wait minutes or hours during a long session. Is this latency acceptable for all message types, or should high-priority messages have a faster path?
- How long do messages persist in the queue? Is there a TTL, and what happens to messages that expire before being processed?
- Should the outbox and message queue be per-workspace or global? A global queue makes cross-workspace messaging simple but creates coordination complexity.

### Periodic analysis agents

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs scheduled tasks)

Agents on a schedule that proactively identify issues, gaps, improvement opportunities:

- **Weekly: Code health scan** -- `architecture-scalability-audit` on modules not audited in 30 days
- **Weekly: Test coverage scan** -- files modified with zero/low test coverage
- **Weekly: Documentation drift scan** -- recently merged PRs changed behavior described in docs
- **Monthly: Dependency health scan** -- CVEs, active forks, lighter alternatives
- **Monthly: Performance baseline** -- benchmark scenarios vs previous month
- **Continuous: Security scan** -- on every PR merge, OWASP top 10 patterns in changed files
- **Monthly: Ideas generation** -- `wr.discovery` on codebase + backlog + session history, asking "what's the most impactful thing we could build next?"

**Things to hash out:**
- Each weekly/monthly agent runs on a schedule. What is the concurrency interaction with active task sessions? Do analysis agents run in background slots, or do they compete for the same pool?
- The "Monthly: Ideas generation" agent can write to the backlog. Who reviews ideas before they are acted upon? Without a review gate, the backlog could accumulate LLM-generated noise.
- What triggers the continuous security scan on every PR merge? Is this a delivery hook, a webhook, or a polling trigger? The latency requirement ("continuous") is different from the weekly scans.
- Should these agents be configurable per workspace (enable/disable, change schedule) or globally controlled by WorkTrain?
- What is the cost profile for running all of these agents monthly? Token cost, LLM API cost, and compute time add up across a busy repo.

### Monitoring, analytics, and autonomous remediation

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain watches application health metrics (error rate, latency, session success/failure rate, queue depth), identifies anomalies, investigates root causes, and resolves what it can automatically.

**Monitoring loop:** Detect anomaly -> classify severity -> investigate with `bug-investigation.agentic.v2` -> if confidence >= 0.8 and severity <= High, attempt auto-remediation (config/feature-flag fix, code fix) or else escalate with full findings.

**Analytics dashboard:** Per-module PR cycle time, workflow step failure rates, token cost per session type, quality score (weighted composite of review accuracy + coding success rate + investigation accuracy).

**Things to hash out:**
- "Auto-remediation (config/feature-flag fix, code fix)" is a significant autonomous action in response to a production anomaly. What safeguards prevent a false positive from triggering a harmful automated change?
- What is the source of "application health metrics" -- is WorkTrain reading from an external monitoring system, or monitoring its own daemon health? These are very different scopes.
- The quality score is a weighted composite. Who determines the weights, and how are they recalibrated when the component metrics change?
- How does this interact with the knowledge graph and session store? The analytics dashboard presumably reads from both -- is there a query API, or is it direct file reads?
- "Continuous security scan on every PR merge" plus auto-remediation is a very tight loop. Who is responsible for reviewing auto-applied security fixes before they reach main?

### Cross-repo execution model

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium (post-MVP for hosted tier)

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Problem:** WorkRail currently assumes a single repo. The autonomous daemon breaks this -- a coding task may touch Android, iOS, and a backend API simultaneously.

**Workspace manifest:** Sessions declare which repos they need:
```json
{
  "context": {
    "repos": [
      { "name": "android", "path": "~/git/my-project/android" },
      { "name": "backend", "path": "~/git/my-project/backend" }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Scoped tools:** `BashInRepo`, `ReadRepo`, `WriteRepo` that route to the correct working directory.

**Dynamic provisioning:** If the repo is already cloned locally, use it. If declared as a remote URL, clone to `~/.workrail/repos/<name>/`.

**This is the feature that makes WorkRail truly freestanding** for multi-repo development teams.

**Things to hash out:**
- `BashInRepo`, `ReadRepo`, `WriteRepo` are new tool variants scoped to a named repo. How does the agent know which repo to address -- is the repo name part of the tool call, or is the default repo set at session start?
- If a session spans repos with different languages (Android/Kotlin + backend/TypeScript), does WorkRail need language-aware context strategies for each, or is the tooling language-agnostic?
- Dynamically cloning a repo to `~/.workrail/repos/<name>/` at session start could take significant time for large repos. Is this acceptable latency, or does the design require pre-cloned repos?
- Cross-repo sessions that make commits to multiple repos need atomic rollback semantics if one repo's commit fails. Is this in scope, or is it the agent's responsibility?
- Should cross-repo sessions be allowed for solo developers with a single GitHub account, or does this primarily target team setups with broader permissions?

### Long-term vision: WorkRail as a general engine, domain packs as configuration

**Status: idea** | Priority: long-term

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain is not just a coding tool. The underlying engine -- session management, workflow enforcement, daemon, agent loop, knowledge graph, context bundle assembly -- is domain-agnostic.

**Domain packs:** Self-contained configuration bundles that specialize WorkTrain for a specific problem domain: a set of workflows, a knowledge graph schema, context bundle query definitions, trigger definitions, a daemon soul template.

**Examples:** `worktrain-coding` (current default), `worktrain-research`, `worktrain-creative`, `worktrain-ops`, `worktrain-data`.

**When to make it explicit:** The right time is when a second domain is ready to be added. Extract the coding-specific pieces into `worktrain-coding` and establish the domain pack contract.

**Things to hash out:**
- What exactly is the boundary between the "domain-agnostic engine" and the "coding domain pack"? Some features feel fundamental (session store, HMAC tokens) while others feel domain-specific (worktree management, git integration). Where is the line?
- How would domain packs be distributed and versioned? Is this a package manager model, a git submodule, or a bundled registry?
- Can multiple domain packs be active simultaneously for a single workspace, or is it one pack per workspace?
- The "right time is when a second domain is ready" -- what does "ready" mean? A prototype, a production use case, or explicit user demand?

### WorkTrain as a native macOS app (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: low / long-term

**Score: 6** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:1 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Long-term vision: WorkTrain becomes a full native Mac app -- menubar icon, system notifications, windows, native UX.

**What this unlocks:** always-on menubar presence showing daemon status; native macOS notifications (currently via osascript -- the app version would use UserNotifications framework directly); `worktrain status` overview as a native window; message queue and inbox as a native interface; background daemon management from the menubar without terminal.

**Tech stack options:**
- Swift/SwiftUI: full native, best macOS integration
- Tauri: Rust core + existing web frontend, lighter than Electron (recommended path)
- Electron + existing console UI: fastest path, same TypeScript codebase, but heavy

**Things to hash out:**
- A native app wrapping a daemon means the daemon becomes an app subprocess or a launchd service. Which model fits better, and does it change the daemon's lifecycle management?
- Tauri requires Rust knowledge that the current team may not have. Is the recommended path realistic given the team's current skills?
- macOS Gatekeeper and notarization requirements add significant release overhead for a signed app. Is this factored into the timeline estimate?
- How does the macOS app interact with the existing console web UI? Are they two separate UIs, or does the native app embed the web console?
- What happens to the CLI (`worktrain` commands) in the native app world -- do they remain the primary interface or become secondary?

### Long-running sessions: stay open across agent handoffs (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs session continuation)

Today when an MR review session completes, it writes its findings and exits. If the findings require fixes, a new fix agent starts from scratch with no shared context. Three sessions that are logically one unit of work are isolated from each other.

**The vision:** a session can stay open and wait -- dormant but alive -- while another agent does work. When that work completes, the waiting session resumes with full context continuity.

**The MR review example:**
```
[MR review session]  finds: 2 critical, 3 minor
  -> stays open, waiting for fixes
  [Fix agent session]  addresses all 5 findings -> signals "fixes ready"
[MR review session resumes]  re-reads the diff, re-evaluates
  -> all 5 verified fixed, 0 new findings -> completes with APPROVE verdict
```

The same session that found the issues verifies the fixes. No context reconstruction. No risk of re-review missing something the original reviewer knew.

**Requires:** session continuation / post-completion phases architecture (already in the backlog under "Session as a living append-only record").

**Things to hash out:**
- A dormant-but-alive session holds its conversation history in memory or must it be re-loaded from the event store on resume? If re-loaded, does the LLM truly have "full context continuity," or is it a reconstruction?
- How long can a session remain dormant? If the fix agent takes 2 hours, the reviewing session holds its slot for 2 hours. Is that acceptable given concurrency limits?
- What signals the reviewing session that "fixes are ready"? Is this a steer injection, a new `await_sessions` result, or a tool call from the fix agent?
- What happens if the fix agent fails or produces a partial fix? Does the reviewing session resume anyway, or only on clean completion?
- Should dormant sessions count against `maxConcurrentSessions`? If yes, long-running coordinated pipelines could exhaust the pool.

### Coordinatable workflow steps: confirmation points the coordinator can satisfy (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium -- needs discovery before implementation

Workflows already have `requireConfirmation: true` on certain steps -- these are natural coordination points. Right now they pause for a human. The idea is to make them also pausable-for-a-coordinator, so a coordinator (or another agent) can be the one that responds instead of a human.

**The vision:** a workflow reaches a `requireConfirmation` step. In MCP mode (human-driven), it behaves exactly as today -- pauses and waits. In daemon/coordinator mode, instead of blocking forever, the coordinator can:
- Inject a synthesized answer based on external work it just did ("architecture review found X, proceed with approach A")
- Spawn another agent to generate the answer and inject its output
- Simply forward a human's message from the message queue

The original session never knows whether a human or a coordinator satisfied the confirmation. It just receives the next turn with context.

**Open design questions:** How does the coordinator "subscribe" to pending confirmations? What's the protocol for injecting the response -- is it a steer, or a new continue_workflow call? What if a coordinator response conflicts with what the human would have said?

**Things to hash out:**
- Should the coordinator be able to satisfy any `requireConfirmation` step, or only steps explicitly marked as coordinator-satisfiable? An unexpected coordinator response on a step intended for human review could bypass important gates.
- If both a coordinator response and a human message queue entry are available for the same confirmation, which takes precedence?
- How does the session handle a confirmation that arrives after the session has timed out waiting? Is the response discarded, or does it attempt to resume the session?
- What is the audit trail for coordinator-satisfied confirmations? Operators need to be able to see "this gate was satisfied by the coordinator with this reasoning" distinct from human approvals.

### wr.shaping workflow: shape messy problems into implementation-ready specs (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: ready to author** | Priority: medium

**Score: 11** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

WorkRail has `wr.discovery` (divergent) and `coding-task-workflow-agentic` (convergent). Shaping is the missing middle -- converting messy discovery output into a bounded, implementation-ready spec without mid-implementation rabbit holes.

**Design docs:** `docs/design/shaping-workflow-discovery.md` (WorkRail-internal discovery findings), `docs/design/shaping-workflow-external-research.md` (Shape Up, LLM failure modes, artifact schema).

**The 11-step skeleton:**
1. `ingest_and_extract` -- extract problem frames, forces, open questions
2. `frame_gate` -- MANDATORY HUMAN GATE: confirm problem + appetite
3. `diverge_solution_shapes` -- 4 parallel rough shapes with varied framings
4. `converge_pick` -- SEPARATE JUDGE (different model/prompt): pick best shape
5. `breadboard_and_elements` -- fat-marker breadboard + Interface/Invariant/Exclusion classification
6. `rabbit_holes_nogos` -- adversarial: risks, mitigations, no-gos
7. `scope_and_slices` -- break into implementable slices with dependencies
8. `spec_draft` -- write the shaped pitch in full (problem + appetite + solution + no-gos + slices)
9. `spec_review` -- second-pass review of the spec for completeness and ambiguity
10. `spec_gate` -- MANDATORY HUMAN GATE: approve spec before implementation starts
11. `output_artifacts` -- write `current-shape.json`, `SPEC.md`; update `open-work-inventory.md`

**Things to hash out:**
- `diverge_solution_shapes` produces 4 parallel shapes. Does this mean 4 parallel sessions, or 4 outputs from a single session? The resource and token cost differs significantly.
- `converge_pick` uses a "SEPARATE JUDGE (different model/prompt)." How is this different model/prompt configured -- is it a different workflow step, a different API call, or a workaround for bias?
- Who reads and validates the shaped spec between `spec_review` and the `spec_gate` human approval? If the human doesn't have context from the earlier steps, the gate is rubber-stamping.
- The 11-step workflow writes to `open-work-inventory.md` in the final step. This is a shared planning file -- what happens if two shaping sessions run concurrently for different problems?
- `Status: ready to author` -- what is blocking authoring? Is this waiting on the artifacts-as-first-class-citizens feature, or can it be authored with the current filesystem-based approach?

### Artifacts as first-class citizens: explorable, accessible, out of the repo (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Every autonomous session dumps `design-candidates.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, `design-review-findings.md` etc. as files in the repo root or worktrees. They are: not indexed or searchable, not visible in the console, not accessible to other sessions, polluting the repo with ephemeral working documents, lost when worktrees are cleaned up.

**The right model:** artifacts are WorkTrain data, not filesystem files. Any structured output from a session that has value beyond the session itself -- handoff docs, design candidates, implementation plans, review findings, spec files, investigation summaries -- should be stored in the session store and accessible via the console.

**What an artifact is:** a named, typed, versioned blob produced by a session. Stored in `~/.workrail/data/artifacts/<sessionId>/`. Referenced from the session event log via `artifact_recorded` event. Accessible to other sessions via `read_artifact(sessionId, name)`.

**Console integration:** "Artifacts" tab on session detail. Each artifact shows name, type, size, and content. "Add to repo" button copies the artifact to the workspace as a markdown file for the cases where the author wants it in git.

**Build order:** `artifact_recorded` event kind in the session store; `read_artifact` tool for daemon agents; Console artifacts tab; garbage collection policy (artifacts older than N days deleted unless pinned).

**Things to hash out:**
- If artifacts replace filesystem files, what happens to the existing workflow steps that write to `design-candidates.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, etc. in the repo? Is migration required, or do both models coexist?
- What is the artifact storage format -- raw Markdown, structured JSON, or type-specific? How does the console render artifacts of different types?
- The `read_artifact(sessionId, name)` API gives any session read access to any other session's artifacts. What is the authorization model -- should all sessions have access to all artifacts, or is it scoped to related sessions?
- How does garbage collection interact with the console's "Artifacts" tab? If an artifact is displayed in the console but has been garbage collected, what does the user see?
- Are artifacts immutable once written, or can a session append to or replace an existing artifact?

### Business model (tentative)

Three tiers:

| Tier | Who | Price | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|-------|
| **Personal / OSS** | Individual devs, open-source projects, non-commercial | Free forever | Builds community, reputation, workflow library. Never charge for this. |
| **Corporate self-hosted** | Companies running WorkRail on their own infrastructure | Paid license | Data never leaves their VPC. Priced per seat or per org. |
| **WorkRail Auto (cloud)** | Anyone who wants managed, zero-ops | Paid subscription | Higher price, lower friction. Pre-configured integrations. |

**License model options:**
- **Dual-license:** AGPL for open-source use, commercial license for everyone else who doesn't want AGPL obligations
- **MIT core + paid features:** Core engine stays MIT forever, advanced features (hosted dashboard, enterprise SSO, multi-tenant credential vault, audit logs) are paid

**The corporate self-hosted market is often the most lucrative.** Enterprises pay well for "runs in our VPC, vendor can't see our code." GitLab, Grafana, Jira -- all built significant businesses on self-hosted enterprise licenses before or alongside their cloud offerings.

**What NOT to do:** Don't charge for the workflow library or the core MCP protocol. Those are the commons that make WorkRail valuable. Charge for the infrastructure layer, not the knowledge layer.

**Priority:** Don't worry about this until there are users.

**Things to hash out:**
- The AGPL dual-license model requires companies using WorkRail in their products to either open-source those products or buy a commercial license. Is this the intended friction, and is it calibrated correctly for the target market?
- What qualifies as "commercial use" in the MIT core + paid features model? A company running the free engine internally without distributing it -- is that commercial use?
- Who decides which features are "advanced" (paid) vs "core" (free)? This decision shapes the community's willingness to contribute.
- The corporate self-hosted market requires sales, invoicing, and legal infrastructure. Is there a plan for those operational capabilities, or is this purely a product decision for now?
- How does the open-source community react if features they contributed to are moved behind a paywall? Is there a policy for handling contributions to the paid tier?

### WorkTrain benchmarking: prove it's better, publish the results (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:3 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

If WorkTrain can demonstrably outperform one-shot LLM calls and human-in-the-loop for specific task types, with reproducible benchmarks published in GitHub and visible in the console, that's the killer adoption argument.

**What to benchmark:**

| Dimension | WorkTrain | One-shot | Human-in-loop |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| MR review finding rate (Critical/Major caught) | ? | ? | ? |
| False positive rate | ? | ? | ? |
| Coding task correctness (builds + tests pass) | ? | ? | ? |
| Bug investigation accuracy (correct root cause) | ? | ? | ? |
| Time to complete | ? | ? | ? |
| Token cost per task | ? | ? | ? |

**Also within WorkTrain:** Haiku (fast, cheap) vs Sonnet (balanced) vs Opus (best) for each task type. Does workflow structure make Haiku competitive with Sonnet one-shot? (hypothesis: yes, for structured tasks)

**The benchmark suite:**
1. MR review benchmark -- 50 PRs with known ground truth. Score: recall + precision.
2. Coding task benchmark -- 50 tasks with objective completion criteria. Score: % completing correctly on first autonomous run.
3. Bug investigation benchmark -- 30 real bugs with known root causes. Score: % identifying correct root cause.
4. Discovery quality benchmark -- 20 design questions with expert-evaluated answers.

**How to publish:** `docs/benchmarks/` directory, GitHub Actions CI job on each release, Console "Benchmarks" tab, badge in README: "MR review recall: 87% (Sonnet 4.6, v3.36.0)".

**Starting point:** the mr-review workflow. Start with 20 PRs where bugs were later discovered and 20 PRs that shipped cleanly. Run each through `mr-review-workflow-agentic` on several model tiers. That's a publishable result with one weekend of work.

**Things to hash out:**
- "Ground truth" for benchmark PRs requires human expert labeling of what the correct findings should be. Who does this labeling, and how is inter-rater reliability ensured?
- Benchmark results are model-version-specific. When a new model version releases, do all benchmarks need to be re-run? What is the cost and cadence?
- Publishing benchmarks that compare WorkTrain to "one-shot LLM" requires a controlled experimental setup. How are prompt and model variables controlled for the one-shot baseline?
- Should benchmark results be published even when they show WorkTrain performing worse than expected? The commitment to honest benchmarking needs to be explicit.
- A CI job that runs 50 PR reviews on every release is extremely expensive. What is the governance for this -- is it run manually, on major releases only, or on a separate schedule?

### Autonomous feature development: scope -> breakdown -> parallel execution -> merge (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs native multi-agent + scripts-first coordinator)

Give WorkTrain a feature scope -- from a vague idea to a fully groomed ticket -- and it figures out the rest. Discovery if needed, design if needed, breakdown into parallel slices, execution across worktrees, context management across agents, bringing it all back together.

**The four pillars:**
1. **Autonomy** -- WorkTrain takes a scope and figures out the work breakdown without hand-holding
2. **Quality** -- comes FROM autonomy + workflow enforcement + coordination
3. **Throughput** -- parallel slices across worktrees simultaneously
4. **Visibility** -- one coherent work unit you can track at a glance

**The pipeline for a scope:**
```
Input: "add GitHub polling support" (any level of definition)
  -> [if vague] ideation + spec authoring
  -> classify-task -> taskComplexity, hasUI, touchesArchitecture, taskMaturity
  -> [if Medium/Large] discovery
  -> [if touchesArchitecture] design + review
  -> breakdown -> parallel slices with dependency graph
       Slice 1: types + schema         (worktree A)
       Slice 2: polling adapter        (worktree B, depends: 1)
       Slice 3: scheduler integration  (worktree C, depends: 2)
       Slice 4: tests                 (worktree D, depends: 1-3)
  -> [parallel execution] each slice: implement -> review -> approved
  -> [serial integration] merge slices in dependency order
  -> [final] integration test -> PR created -> notification
```

**Context management:** Coordinator maintains a "work unit manifest" (current phase, slice status, shared invariants, decisions). Each spawned agent receives a context bundle. After each agent completes, its findings update the manifest.

**The coordinator's job (scripts, not LLM):** maintain the manifest, compute the dependency graph, decide parallelism vs serialization, route outcomes, track worktrees, detect conflicts, sequence merge order.

**The minimum viable version:** a coordinator that handles a Medium/Small scoped task -- takes 2-4 parallel slices, runs them, reviews each, merges when clean. No escalation handling in v1.

**Things to hash out:**
- "WorkTrain figures out the breakdown" -- how does it decompose a feature into independent, parallelizable slices without human input? What is the decision process, and how does it handle tasks that are fundamentally sequential?
- Parallel slices across worktrees can produce merge conflicts when their branches are integrated. Who detects and resolves conflicts -- the coordinator script or the agent?
- The breakdown step requires predicting which slices depend on which. Incorrect dependency analysis could cause a slice to start before its dependencies are complete. How is this validated before parallel execution begins?
- Is the "minimum viable version" intended to run fully autonomously, or does it require human review between phases?
- How does this relate to the full development pipeline entry earlier in the backlog? Are these the same concept or parallel efforts?

### WorkTrain analytics: stats, time saved, and quality metrics (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain should be accountable. Not just "it did work" but "did it do good work?" Stats without quality metrics are vanity. Quality metrics without stats lack context.

**Volume stats:** PRs opened/merged, PRs reviewed, bugs investigated, tasks completed, discoveries run, issues filed/resolved. Derived from session store + merge audit log + GitHub/Jira API.

**Time saved estimates:** calibrated human-equivalent time estimate per workflow type (e.g. MR review STANDARD = 25 min, coding task Medium = 2h). Honest: "Time saved is only real if the work would have been done by a human."

**Quality metrics:**
- MR reviews: reviews with 0 findings / reviews that caught Critical / reviews where human disagreed
- Coding tasks: PRs merged without rework / PRs that needed fix cycles / post-merge bug rate
- Bug investigations: correct root cause identified / confidence was too high (wrong) / escalated correctly
- **Overall quality score** (weighted composite): if score drops below 70, auto-trigger `workflow-effectiveness-assessment`

**Quality feedback loop:** post-merge outcome tracking (bugs filed against WorkTrain PRs within 30 days), MR review validation (author disputes a finding = signal), human override tracking, explicit `worktrain feedback "..."` command appending to `~/.workrail/feedback.jsonl`.

**Console Analytics tab:** quality score trend, volume/quality/cost summary, anomaly callouts with links to `workflow-effectiveness-assessment`.

**Things to hash out:**
- "Time saved" estimates require knowing what a human would have done in the same time. This is inherently speculative. How is the calibration model updated as norms change?
- "Reviews where human disagreed" requires a mechanism for tracking disagreement. What is the interface for a human to signal disagreement with a WorkTrain finding -- a label, a comment keyword, or an explicit command?
- The quality score dropping below 70 auto-triggers `workflow-effectiveness-assessment`. Who defines the threshold, and is it configurable per workspace or global?
- Post-merge bug tracking (bugs within 30 days) requires attributing bugs to specific PRs. What is the attribution mechanism -- PR metadata, commit SHA tracking, or manual annotation?
- The analytics data requires access to GitHub/Jira APIs. Who manages token rotation for these read-access integrations, and what happens when they expire?

### Live status briefings: WorkTrain narrates its own work in human terms (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

**The problem:** WorkTrain is doing a lot. Sessions are running, PRs are open, the queue has items. But the raw view -- session IDs, PR numbers, branch names -- is only meaningful to someone who's been following along. A user who checks in after a few hours needs a human-readable briefing, not a list of `sess_abc123` entries.

**`worktrain status` command:** assembles a briefing by reading active sessions (what's running, which step, how long), queue state, recent completions, blocked/waiting items. Summarizes each session in 2-3 plain English lines: what is being built, why it matters, where it is.

**Adaptation:** `--audience owner` (full technical detail, default) vs `--audience stakeholder` (capability level, no PR numbers) vs `--audience external` (outcome level, no internal terminology).

**Console Status tab** (default view): live session list with step progress, queue next items, done today. Updates via SSE. Click any row to expand.

**Push notifications:** milestone completions ("WorkTrain shipped: worktrain init is live"), blockers surfaced ("PR #406 came back with 2 issues -- fixing automatically, estimated 20 min"), optional daily digest.

**Things to hash out:**
- The briefing LLM call requires a full context assembly pass (session store, queue state, recent completions). This is expensive. Should `worktrain status` be a live query or cached periodically?
- Audience adaptation (`--audience stakeholder`) requires understanding what "capability level" vs "technical detail" means for each piece of information. Who defines this mapping?
- Push notifications require a notification channel (Slack, email, macOS, etc.). How does the user configure which channel(s) to use, and what is the default?
- "Estimated 20 min" requires the workflow execution time prediction system to be built first. Is the status briefing gated on that feature?
- Should the Console Status tab replace the existing Sessions tab as the default view, or be an additional tab?

### Pattern and architecture validation: WorkTrain enforces team conventions (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Beyond reviewing code for bugs, WorkTrain validates that the code matches the patterns and architecture the team expects.

**Two levels:**

**1. Philosophy lens (already partially built):** extend to be per-workspace configurable, and make some patterns machine-checkable (no direct db access outside the repository layer, no `console.log` in production code, no `any` types) rather than relying on the LLM.

**2. Architectural invariant checking (new):**
```yaml
workspaces:
  workrail:
    architectureRules:
      - id: no-daemon-imports-from-mcp
        rule: "src/daemon/** must not import from src/mcp/**"
        type: import_boundary
        severity: error
      - id: errors-as-data
        rule: "No throw statements in src/daemon/** -- use Result types"
        type: no_throw
        severity: warning
        exceptions: ["constructor", "assertExhaustive"]
      - id: no-exec-shell
        rule: "No child_process.exec() -- use execFile() with args array"
        type: forbidden_call
        severity: error
```

These rules run as scripts (static analysis, not LLM) -- fast, deterministic, zero tokens. Checked during coding-task workflow, as part of CI, and by the periodic architecture scan.

**The self-improvement connection:** when `workflow-effectiveness-assessment` finds that a class of bug appears repeatedly (e.g. "3 of the last 5 coding tasks had shell injection risks"), it can propose a new architecture rule that prevents the pattern going forward. Rules start as soft warnings, graduate to errors after validation. WorkTrain learns from its own failure patterns and codifies them as invariants.

**Things to hash out:**
- Static analysis rules (import boundaries, forbidden calls) are different from philosophy lens rules (LLM-evaluated). Should they live in the same configuration file and enforcement mechanism?
- Who owns the `architectureRules` configuration per workspace -- the workspace team, the workflow author, or WorkTrain itself? Conflicting ownership creates maintenance friction.
- When a new architecture rule is auto-proposed from failure patterns, how does it get reviewed and graduated from warning to error? Is there a human approval gate in the self-improvement loop?
- How does architecture rule enforcement interact with existing CI checks? Should WorkRail generate a lint-style CI step from the `architectureRules` config?
- Rules like "no throw in src/daemon/**" require nuance (exceptions for constructors). How is the exceptions list kept current as the codebase evolves?

### Resource management: preventing agent congestion under high concurrency (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Running many simultaneous agents creates API rate limit bursts, host resource pressure, and context degradation. The `maxConcurrentSessions` semaphore addresses the daemon-level cap, but the broader resource management problem has several dimensions.

**The dimensions:**
1. **API rate limits** -- token-bucket rate limiter shared across all sessions: before each LLM call, acquire a slot from the bucket
2. **Host machine resources** -- each agent loop runs in-process, consuming RAM and CPU
3. **Tiered concurrency by task type** -- `coding-task-workflow-agentic: 2` (expensive), `mr-review: 3` (medium), `wr.discovery: 5` (cheap)
4. **Queue-aware throttling** -- prefer starting high-priority items even if slots are available for low-priority ones
5. **Graceful degradation** -- slow down polling intervals, prefer fast/cheap workflows, pause the queue drain when under load

**Build order:**
1. `maxConcurrentSessions` semaphore (simple global cap)
2. Token-bucket rate limiter in the agent loop
3. Per-workflow-type concurrency limits
4. Queue-aware slot allocation (high-priority first)
5. Adaptive throttling based on observed latency

**Things to hash out:**
- The token-bucket rate limiter must be shared across all concurrent sessions. Where does it live -- daemon-global singleton, or a lightweight IPC mechanism? Thread safety is required.
- Tiered concurrency limits by workflow type require the daemon to know the workflow type at dispatch time. How is this derived for dynamically dispatched sessions where the workflow is set at runtime?
- "Host machine resources" monitoring requires either OS-level telemetry (CPU, RAM sampling) or inference from session count. Which is more reliable for the adaptive throttling use case?
- Graceful degradation that pauses queue draining could leave important high-priority items waiting behind lower-priority work. Does degradation mode need priority awareness?
- What is the interaction between resource limits and the `worktrain kill-sessions` kill switch? Should resource exhaustion trigger a softer intervention before escalating to kill?

### Universal integration layer: WorkTrain interfaces with everything (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain is not opinionated about your stack. It works with whatever version control, project management, communication, monitoring, and documentation systems you use.

**Integration categories:**
- **Version control:** GitHub, GitLab (already done), Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, Gitea, raw git
- **Project management:** GitHub Issues, GitLab Issues, Jira (Cloud + Server), Linear, Asana, Notion, Monday.com, Azure Boards
- **Communication:** Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Telegram, Email, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, generic webhook
- **Monitoring:** Sentry, Datadog, New Relic, Grafana/Prometheus, CloudWatch, custom HTTP endpoint
- **Documentation:** Confluence, Notion, Google Docs, Markdown in repo, Docusaurus

**Three integration modes (all already architected):**
1. **Polling source** -- WorkTrain calls the external API on a schedule, deduplicates events, dispatches workflows
2. **Delivery target** -- WorkTrain POSTs results to an external system when a workflow completes
3. **Reference context** -- WorkTrain fetches external documents and injects them into agent context

**The integration manifest in triggers.yml:**
```yaml
integrations:
  github:
    token: $GITHUB_TOKEN
  jira:
    token: $JIRA_TOKEN
    baseUrl: https://mycompany.atlassian.net
  slack:
    webhookUrl: $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
    channels:
      reviews: "#code-review"
      incidents: "#incidents"
```

**Build order:** generic `callbackUrl` (already works); GitHub polling (same as GitLab, already written as template), Slack delivery (format + post to webhook); Jira polling + delivery (high enterprise value); Linear polling (high startup value); PagerDuty delivery. Each adapter is a bounded, testable, independently shippable unit.

**Things to hash out:**
- The integration manifest in `triggers.yml` centralizes credentials for all external systems. Is this the right location, or should credentials live in a separate secrets file (like `~/.workrail/.env`)?
- Each integration adapter is "independently shippable" -- but they share no common testing infrastructure. How is integration adapter quality maintained as the number of adapters grows?
- What is the versioning policy for integration adapters? If an external API changes (e.g. Jira Cloud v3 -> v4), how are adapter updates coordinated with WorkTrain releases?
- The "three integration modes" cover polling, delivery, and reference context. Are there integration use cases that don't fit these three modes?
- Who is the target user for the universal integration layer -- solo developers, small teams, or enterprise teams? The complexity of configuring many integrations is higher than the current single-trigger setup.

**Score: 6** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:1 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain monitors your communication channels, understands context, and either responds on your behalf or prepares vetted drafts for you to send.

**Slack:** Monitor specified channels and DMs for messages that mention you, reference your projects, or require a response. Options: auto-respond for routine questions, draft a response for your review, or surface with a notification. Configurable per-channel.

**Email:** Monitor inbox, understand context, draft responses. Suggest email filters, folder rules, and unsubscribe candidates based on patterns. Priority surfacing: "3 emails need a response, here are the drafts."

**Important constraint:** WorkTrain never sends on your behalf without explicit approval for anything that goes to other people. Auto-respond is opt-in per-channel, with a review window before sending.

**Things to hash out:**
- Slack monitoring requires a Slack app with appropriate scopes. What is the setup experience -- does WorkTrain ship a Slack app manifest, or does the user create an app from scratch?
- The "review window before sending" implies the agent drafts a response and waits. What is the window duration, and what happens if the user doesn't review within the window?
- Email monitoring is significantly more sensitive than Slack. What are the minimum required email scopes, and how does WorkTrain prevent accidentally reading sensitive or confidential messages?
- Auto-respond for Slack is opt-in per-channel. If a channel is not explicitly opted in, are all messages in that channel completely invisible to WorkTrain?
- This is a significant scope expansion beyond code-related automation. What is the explicit boundary between WorkTrain as a coding tool and WorkTrain as a general productivity tool?

With many concurrent agents using `branchStrategy: worktree`, worktrees accumulate. 10 agents running all day can produce dozens of worktrees, each triggering `git status` processes that saturate the host CPU.

**What's needed:**
1. **Automatic cleanup on session end** -- when a WorkTrain session completes (success or failure), the daemon automatically runs `git worktree remove <path> --force`. If the branch is already merged to main, also delete the local branch ref.
2. **Startup pruning** -- `worktrain daemon` startup runs `git worktree prune` in each configured workspace before starting the trigger listener.
3. **`worktrain worktree list`** -- shows all WorkTrain-managed worktrees: path, branch, session ID, age, whether the branch is merged.
4. **`worktrain worktree clean`** -- removes all worktrees whose branches are merged to main, or older than N days. Dry-run mode by default.
5. **`worktrain worktree status`** -- summary: count, total disk usage, any stale ones.

**Things to hash out:**
- `git worktree remove --force` discards uncommitted changes without warning. What is the policy for worktrees with uncommitted or unstaged work on session end? Is force-removal always safe?
- "If the branch is already merged to main, also delete the local branch ref" -- what constitutes "merged"? Squash-merges don't leave an ancestor relationship in git history. How is squash-merge detection handled?
- Startup pruning runs before the trigger listener starts. What is the time cost for pruning across many workspaces with many worktrees? Could it delay daemon startup noticeably?
- Should cleanup be skipped for manually-created worktrees (not WorkTrain-managed)? How does the cleanup tool distinguish WorkTrain-managed from human-created worktrees?

Critical for parallel work. WorkTrain needs native, sophisticated git management -- not just running git commands but understanding the full branching topology.

**Worktree management:** Create, list, switch between, and clean up worktrees automatically. Detect and warn about stale worktrees (branches that have been merged or abandoned).

**Branch lifecycle:** Know which branches are: active (being worked on), stale (no commits in N days), merged (on main), or orphaned (created but abandoned). Automatic cleanup proposals. Rebase management when main advances. Conflict detection before spawning a new session.

**Parallel work coordination:** When multiple tasks touch the same files, WorkTrain detects potential conflicts before they happen. Sequences tasks that would conflict, parallelizes those that won't. Maintains a "file lock" mental model.

**The `worktrain worktree` command family:**
```bash
worktrain worktree list                    # all worktrees and their status
worktrain worktree clean                   # remove merged/stale worktrees
worktrain worktree new <branch> [--task]   # create worktree + optionally link to queue item
worktrain worktree status                  # which files are locked by active sessions
```

Especially critical when WorkTrain is managing 10+ concurrent sessions -- without explicit worktree management, two sessions could clobber each other's changes on the same branch.

**Things to hash out:**
- The "file lock" mental model requires knowing which files each active session is touching. How is this tracked -- by inspecting the worktree, by recording what files each session reads/writes, or by static analysis of the task?
- Conflict detection before spawning is a prediction problem (which files will this session touch?). What is the accuracy requirement, and what is the cost of a false positive (unnecessarily serializing work)?
- "Rebase management when main advances" is a significant automated git action. Who triggers the rebase -- the daemon on a schedule, the coordinator, or the session itself?
- The command family (`worktrain worktree list`, `worktrain worktree clean`, etc.) overlaps significantly with the worktree lifecycle management entry above. Should these be unified into a single design effort?

### The single-conversation problem: WorkTrain needs multi-threaded interaction (Apr 16, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 6** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:1 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

When WorkTrain is managing 10 concurrent agents, a single chat where everything is happening at the same time is not ideal. You can't follow any one thread or distinguish "in progress" from "needs a decision."

**Threaded conversations per work group:** each active work group gets its own conversation thread. You can follow the polling-triggers work in thread A without seeing the spawn/await implementation in thread B.

**`worktrain talk` shows a thread list:**
```
Threads:
  WorkRail development     [3 active agents, 2 waiting]
  Storyforge chapter work  [idle]
  -> Select thread or type to start a new one
```

**`worktrain idea` for mid-conversation capture:** `worktrain idea "..."` appends to an ideas buffer without interrupting active work. The talk session reviews the buffer at the start of each conversation.

**Things to hash out:**
- What defines a "work group" for the thread list -- is it a workspace, a parent session ID, a trigger ID, or something the user explicitly creates?
- The thread list requires WorkTrain to know which work groups are active. Where does this mapping live, and who maintains it as sessions start and complete?
- Should thread history persist across conversations, or is each `worktrain talk` session a fresh start that synthesizes from the session store?
- `worktrain idea` writes to an ideas buffer. Is this buffer workspace-scoped, global, or per-thread? What is the path for ideas that don't belong to any active thread?

### Console session detail: more than the DAG when running standalone (Apr 16, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The session DAG shows structure but not meaning. When watching a session run in the console without being in Claude Code, you want to know what the agent is actually doing.

**What's missing:**
- The latest step output note, rendered inline and updating as it streams
- A plain-English summary of what the agent is doing right now ("Analyzing the diff for shell injection risks")
- Current step prompt visible on demand
- Token count and cost estimate for the session so far
- Time elapsed + estimated time remaining based on step history
- A live feed of tool calls as they happen ("Reading trigger-router.ts", "Running npm test")

**The streaming step output** is the most valuable addition. Right now the DAG shows a step as "in progress" with a spinner. It should show the last few lines of the step's output note as it's being written.

**Build order:**
1. Inline latest step output in the session detail panel (read from session store, poll every 2s)
2. Live tool call feed alongside the DAG (SSE from the daemon, log each tool call as it fires)
3. Token/cost counter (daemon tracks tokens per session, expose via GET /api/v2/sessions/:id)

**Things to hash out:**
- "Latest step output" streaming via 2s polling means up to 2s latency. For users watching a live session, is this acceptable, or is SSE needed here too?
- The "plain-English summary" ("Analyzing the diff for shell injection risks") requires either real-time LLM inference or a structured feed from the agent. Where does this text come from?
- Current step prompt exposed on demand could reveal sensitive context (workspace paths, credentials passed via goal). Should there be a filter or opt-in before showing prompt content?
- Token cost estimates require knowing the model's pricing, which changes over time and varies by provider. How is the pricing table maintained and kept current?
- "Estimated time remaining" requires historical session data for the same workflow. What is the minimum data needed for a meaningful estimate?

### Orphaned daemon session state: smarter recovery (Apr 16, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:2 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

**The problem:** When the daemon is killed mid-session, the session's in-process `KeyedAsyncQueue` promise chain is lost. On restart, the startup recovery reads orphaned session files -- but any external state tied to the queue is now inconsistent. More critically: if a session stalls (Bedrock call hangs, exception suppressed), the daemon log shows nothing after "Injecting workspace context" -- no error, no completion.

**What needs to happen:**
1. Startup recovery should clear any pending queue slots -- if a session file exists at startup, that trigger's queue key should be treated as free
2. Session liveness detection -- if a session has been `in_progress` for more than N minutes with no `advance_recorded` events, the daemon watchdog should log a warning and optionally abort
3. Orphaned session cleanup should be user-facing -- `worktrain cleanup` or `worktrain status` should surface orphaned sessions with their age and offer to clear them
4. Better logging when `runWorkflow()` swallows errors -- the `void runWorkflow(...)` pattern drops errors silently; every path that ends in silence should log `[WorkflowRunner] Session died silently` with the session ID

**Things to hash out:**
- How long should an orphaned session file be allowed to persist before `worktrain status` marks it as stale? The threshold must account for very long sessions vs actually orphaned ones.
- "Optionally abort" for sessions exceeding N minutes with no advances -- who sets N, and should the threshold differ per workflow (a discovery session naturally advances slowly vs a coding session)?
- Queue slot clearing on startup: if the daemon restarts while a session is genuinely still resumable, clearing its queue slot could lose deduplication state and re-dispatch the same task.
- Should users be notified when an orphaned session is found, or only when they explicitly run `worktrain status`?

### Observability and logging as first-class citizens (Apr 17, 2026)

**Status: partial** -- `worktrain diagnose` shipped May 9, 2026 (PR #979). Deferred items tracked below.

**Score: 11** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

WorkTrain should never be a black box. Every action, decision, failure, and state transition should be traceable after the fact.

**What "first-class" means:**
1. **Structured, not prose** -- every log line machine-parseable with consistent key=value pairs
2. **Levels matter** -- INFO for normal operations, WARN for recoverable anomalies, ERROR for failures. Silence = actively working, not unknown. A session that produces no logs for 5+ minutes should emit a heartbeat.
3. **Every state transition logged** -- session start, step advance, tool call, tool result (including errors), session end
4. **Errors always include context** -- which session, which tool, which step, how long it had been running, what the last successful action was
5. **Correlation IDs** -- every session has a `sessionId`, every tool call has a `toolCallId`; log entries include the relevant ID for cross-session filtering
6. **Log destinations are configurable** -- `--log-level` flag, `--log-format json|human`

**Specific gaps to close:** `continue_workflow` tool should log step ID and notes length; `makeBashTool` should log exit code and output length; `AgentLoop` should log each LLM turn (turn number, stop reason, tool count); `TriggerRouter` should log when a session is queued at capacity.

**The `worktrain logs` command:**
```bash
worktrain logs                          # tail daemon.log
worktrain logs --session sess_abc123    # replay full session from event store
worktrain logs --trigger test-task      # all sessions for this trigger
worktrain logs --level error            # only errors across all sources
worktrain logs --since 1h               # last hour
worktrain logs --format json            # machine-readable output
```

**Self-healing dependency:** the automatic gap detection, WORKTRAIN_STUCK routing, and coordinator self-healing patterns all depend on logs being structured and complete. Logging quality is a prerequisite for autonomous operation at scale.

**Things to hash out:**
- How do structured logs coexist with the existing session event store? Are they the same system, or parallel? Duplicating data in both would create consistency issues.
- Tool call argument logging could expose secrets (file paths, API responses, bash commands). Is there a sanitization policy for log output?
- The `worktrain logs --session` command replays from the event store. How is this different from what the console already shows? Is the CLI version for non-console users or for programmatic processing?
- Log rotation and retention -- how much disk space should logs consume, and who configures the retention policy?
- "Silence = actively working" requires the agent loop to emit heartbeats. What is the heartbeat interval, and is this a new event type in the session store?

**Delivered (May 9, 2026, PR #979):** `worktrain diagnose <sessionId>` -- scans last 7 days of daemon event logs, classifies sessions into CONFIG / WORKFLOW_STUCK / WORKFLOW_TIMEOUT / INFRA / ORPHANED / SUCCESS / DEFAULT, prints a failure card with evidence and suggested fix. `worktrain health <id>` now delegates to diagnose for prior-day sessions (previously returned "No events today"). `--json` and `--ascii` flags. Pure `parseDaemonEvents()` function with injected deps, 22 unit tests.

**Delivered (May 9, 2026, PR #982, #984):** `worktrain diagnose` (no args) shows fleet summary -- outcome breakdown, per-workflow stats, timeout reason counts, token burn. `--workflow` filter. `analyzeFleet()` is a pure typed function with injected deps; `ResultCategory` discriminated union enforces exhaustiveness. 34 unit tests total.

**Still deferred:**
- Step-level analysis in fleet view and per-session deep-dive: `stepId` is now in `step_advanced` daemon events (PR #987, May 9 2026) as a correlation key for the next pending step. Two pieces remain: (a) render `stepId` in `formatStepTimeline()` so `worktrain diagnose` shows step names alongside step numbers (e.g. `→  step 3 (phase-1a-landscape)  5 turns  [STOPPED]`); (b) build `analyzeSessionDeep()` that joins daemon events (stepId, turns, tokens per step) with session store snapshots (step titles from the workflow definition) for full step-level timing. Note: `stepId` in the event is the NEXT step's ID (from `pending`), not the completed step's ID -- keep this semantic when rendering.
- `--since N` flag to widen the scan window beyond 7 days
- `--verbose` flag for full step timeline (currently capped at 8 steps)
- Conversation log `--deep` mode (full LLM turn text for stuck cases where argsSummary is truncated)
- Push-based auto-write to outbox after each non-success session
- Structured `failureCode` field in engine events (eliminate string-matching on `detail` field)
- Console inline integration (show failure card per session in the UI)

### Event sourcing for orchestration: extend the session store to daemon and coordinator events (Apr 17, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

Extend the existing WorkRail event store infrastructure to cover orchestration-level events. The session store is already append-only, crash-safe, content-addressed, and queryable -- rebuilding those properties would be wasteful.

**Multiple event streams, same infrastructure:**
```
~/.workrail/events/
  sessions/          <- already exists (per-session workflow events)
  daemon/            <- lifecycle, triggers, delivery, errors
  triggers/          <- per-trigger poll history and outcomes
  coordinator/       <- coordinator script decisions and routing
```

**Daemon event stream:** structured events like `daemon_started`, `trigger_fired`, `session_queued`, `session_started`, `tool_called`, `step_advanced`, `session_completed`, `delivery_attempted`, `poll_cycle`.

**`DaemonEventEmitter`:** thin wrapper around the event store, called from TriggerRouter, workflow-runner, delivery-client, and polling-scheduler. Zero overhead when nothing is listening. (Note: `DaemonEventEmitter` already ships -- this is about expanding what gets recorded and unifying with the session event store.)

**SSE extension:** the console already streams session events via SSE. Extend to also stream daemon events so the console live feed shows everything: trigger fires, tool calls, delivery attempts, errors -- not just step advances.

**Why this matters for self-healing:** the coordinator can react in real time to `tool_error` events rather than checking for WORKTRAIN_STUCK markers after the fact.

**Things to hash out:**
- The `coordinator/` event stream records coordinator script decisions. Does this require the coordinator to be a first-class WorkTrain concept with an event-emitting API, or can it be retrofit to shell scripts via a CLI command (`worktrain event emit ...`)?
- All four event directories live under `~/.workrail/events/`. What are the size and retention policies per directory? Trigger poll cycles could generate enormous volumes in `triggers/`.
- SSE extension for daemon events means the console must distinguish session events from daemon events in the same stream. What is the event envelope schema for mixed event types?
- Who is the primary consumer of coordinator events -- only the console, or also the coordinator itself (for self-healing)? The use cases have different latency and reliability requirements.

### Duplicate task detection: prevent agents from doing the same work twice (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:2 Cap:1 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:3 | Blocked: no

With multiple agents running concurrently and a persistent work queue, it's easy to accidentally start two agents on the same task -- especially when the queue drains items from external sources that may be added again after a sync.

**Detection sources:**
1. **Open PRs** -- before starting any coding task, check `gh pr list --state open` -- if a PR already exists addressing the same issue/goal, skip it
2. **Active sessions** -- session store knows which workflows are currently running; a new dispatch can check for semantic overlap before starting
3. **Queue deduplication** -- each queue item from an external source carries its `sourceId` (e.g. `github:owner/repo:issues:123`). On enqueue, check if `sourceId` already exists in the queue
4. **Session history** -- before starting an investigation, check recent session notes for the same workflowId + goal combination

**Implementation:** queue-level dedup is the simplest and most reliable. PR-level dedup: before dispatching a coding task, run `gh pr list --search "<issue title keywords>"` and check for matches. For MVP, exact `sourceId` match + approximate PR title search is sufficient. Semantic dedup (same problem described differently) is a post-knowledge-graph feature.

**Things to hash out:**
- Approximate PR title search for dedup can produce false positives (skipping work that is actually unrelated). What is the policy for a false positive -- is the issue left unworked, or escalated?
- `sourceId`-based dedup is reliable only when the same external system generates the ID consistently. What happens for goals dispatched manually via the message queue with no `sourceId`?
- Should dedup checks happen at enqueue time, dispatch time, or both? Enqueue-time dedup is earlier but may not know about concurrent activity; dispatch-time is later but more accurate.
- How long does a `sourceId` remain "in use" for dedup purposes after a session completes? If the issue is re-labeled after a failed session, it should be re-dispatchable.

### Agent actions as first-class events in the session event log (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

The console should be able to reconstruct exactly what an agent did in a session -- every tool call, every argument, every result -- by reading the event log alone.

**What's missing -- agent-level events:**
- `tool_call_started` -- tool name, args, timestamp
- `tool_call_completed` -- result (truncated), duration, success/error
- `llm_turn_started` -- model, input token count
- `llm_turn_completed` -- stop reason, output tokens, tools requested
- `steer_injected` -- what context was injected and why
- `report_issue_recorded` -- the structured issue from the `report_issue` tool

**Where to emit them:** in `src/daemon/agent-loop.ts` before and after each `tool.execute()` call and LLM call; in `src/daemon/workflow-runner.ts` for steer injection.

**Console rendering:** each session detail view gets a "Timeline" tab showing: `llm_turn (450 tokens -> 3 tool calls)`, `bash: git status (45ms)`, `read: AGENTS.md (8ms)`, `llm_turn (280 tokens -> advance)` per phase.

**Build order:** add `tool_call_started`/`tool_call_completed` to `agent-loop.ts` (smallest change, highest value); add `llm_turn_started`/`llm_turn_completed`; Console Timeline tab; wire `report_issue_recorded` and `steer_injected` events; once session events are comprehensive, `DaemonEventEmitter` daily log files become secondary.

**Things to hash out:**
- Tool call arguments are logged for `tool_call_started`. Arguments can contain sensitive content (file content, bash output, API responses). What is the sanitization or truncation policy?
- Every LLM turn logged means every token count is in the session event log. This is useful for analytics but also reveals cost information. Is this data considered sensitive?
- The "Timeline" tab in the console requires the agent-loop events to be in the session store, not just in daemon logs. Does the existing session store schema need to be extended, or is there already a path for agent-loop events?
- Should these events be emitted in MCP (interactive) sessions, or only in daemon sessions? The logging overhead may be more acceptable in one context than the other.

### Context budget per spawned agent (Apr 18, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: yes (needs knowledge graph)

A pre-packaged bundle of ~2000 tokens that every coordinator-spawned agent starts with. The knowledge graph is what makes this scalable.

**Bundle contents:**
- `<relevant_files>` -- paths + key excerpts from files the agent will likely touch (from KG query)
- `<prior_sessions>` -- summaries of the last 3 sessions that touched related code
- `<established_patterns>` -- specific patterns the agent must follow
- `<known_facts>` -- things already proven true
- `<do_not_explore>` -- explicit list of dead ends and already-tried approaches

**Without the KG (today):** the coordinator manually includes key context in the prompt.
**With the KG (future):** `worktrain spawn --workflow X --goal "..."` automatically queries the KG and assembles the context bundle. Coordinator just provides the goal.

**Things to hash out:**
- This entry is closely related to "Coordinator context injection standard" earlier in the backlog. Are these the same idea, or does this entry specifically cover the KG-backed assembly vs the general standard?
- The KG query for "relevant files" must happen before the agent starts. What is the latency of this query, and does it add meaningful overhead to session dispatch time?
- "Prior sessions" summaries require the KG to have indexed session notes. Is session note indexing part of the KG build process, or a separate concern?
- If the KG is stale or unavailable at dispatch time, should the session start without a context bundle, or should dispatch be deferred?

### Work queue refinements: filtering, catch-all mode, and deadline-aware prioritization (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Issue/ticket filtering:** richer than just a label -- filter by project, milestone, assignee, sprint, component. Per-source filter config with `notLabels` exclusion list.

**Catch-all mode:** if `filter` is omitted entirely, WorkTrain pulls everything open and unassigned in the project/repo. Requires explicit `catchAll: true` opt-in + `maxItemsPerCycle` limit.

**Deadline-aware prioritization:** WorkTrain reads deadline context from issue/ticket due dates, epic end dates, sprint end dates, release/milestone dates, and optionally Confluence/Google Calendar. Computes adjusted priority score:
```
deadline_urgency: < 2 days = +3, < 7 days = +2, < 14 days = +1, > 14 days = +0, past due = +4
adjusted_priority = base_priority + deadline_urgency
```

Items are queued in adjusted priority order. A medium-priority task due tomorrow beats a high-priority task due in 3 months.

**Escalation when deadlines are at risk:** if a queue item has a deadline within 48 hours and hasn't been started, the watchdog notifies: bumping to position 1, posting to Slack + message outbox.

**Things to hash out:**
- `base_priority` is referenced in the priority scoring formula but not defined in this entry. Where does base priority come from -- issue labels, explicit priority field, or inferred?
- Reading deadline context from Confluence and Google Calendar requires auth integration. Is this in scope for the initial implementation, or is it a phase 2 concern?
- "Past due = +4" could cause extremely stale tasks to permanently occupy the top of the queue. Is there a cap on urgency boost, or a different treatment for overdue items?
- Bumping a task to position 1 due to deadline urgency could interrupt a work sequence that was deliberately ordered. Who should be notified when an automatic priority bump happens?
- `catchAll: true` pulls all open unassigned items. In an active repo, this could mean hundreds of items entering the queue simultaneously. What is the behavior when `maxItemsPerCycle` is reached?

### Workspace pipeline policy: artifact gates vs autonomous decomposition (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 8** | Cor:1 Cap:2 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**The core tension:** some workspaces have rigorous pre-implementation processes (BRD required, design approved, shapeup doc reviewed). Others are solo/small-team projects where you figure it out as you go. WorkTrain should respect both.

**Two workspace modes:**

**Governed mode** -- for projects with existing process gates:
```yaml
pipelinePolicy:
  mode: governed
  requiredArtifacts:
    - type: brd
      sources: [confluence, jira_epic, google_docs]
      searchQuery: "BRD {{ticket.key}}"
  onMissingArtifacts: wait  # 'wait', 'skip', or 'escalate'
  waitCheckInterval: 3600
  waitTimeout: 168h
```

When WorkTrain picks up a ticket and required artifacts aren't found -- holds the ticket in "waiting" state, re-checks hourly, notifies when artifacts appear. When found, automatically extracts context and proceeds, skipping discovery/design phases since those artifacts already contain the answer.

**Autonomous mode** -- for projects without pre-existing process: WorkTrain runs the full pipeline including discovery, UX design, architecture review, and implementation.

**Automatic task decomposition:** when a task is classified as `Large` (or Medium with high complexity), WorkTrain decomposes it into sub-tickets before starting implementation. Sub-tickets are Small or Medium (never Large), added to the queue with `parentTicketId` and `dependsOn` links.

**The "patiently waiting" UX:** console Queue tab shows tickets waiting for artifacts with a distinct state, plus Slack notification when WorkTrain starts waiting and again when artifacts are found.

**Things to hash out:**
- Governed mode's `waitTimeout: 168h` (one week) means a ticket can hold a queue slot for a week. Does waiting hold a concurrency slot, or is it a separate "pending" state outside the concurrency pool?
- Automatic task decomposition into sub-tickets creates GitHub/Jira issues autonomously. Is this acceptable without human review, or should sub-ticket creation be a gate requiring approval?
- "Large = decompose" requires a reliable `Large` classification. What is the cost of a wrong classification that either skips decomposition (too large a task given to one agent) or decomposes unnecessarily (adding overhead)?
- How does the governed vs autonomous mode selection work? Is it a workspace config flag, or does WorkTrain infer the mode from the presence/absence of artifact gates?
- What does "context injection from BRD" look like at the agent level? Is the BRD injected as a reference, a context bundle field, or the full text?

### Templates, living docs, and external workflow ingestion (Apr 15, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 6** | Cor:1 Cap:1 Eff:1 Lev:1 Con:2 | Blocked: no

**Templates:** WorkTrain knows the templates used in each workspace and applies them automatically. PR templates, Jira ticket templates, design spec templates, BRD templates. Templates are resolved at session start and injected as context. The agent is told "when creating a [type], use this template structure exactly."

**Living docs:** WorkTrain maintains documentation as a first-class output, not an afterthought.
- On-demand: `worktrain doc generate --type architecture-overview --workspace workrail`
- Continuous updates: when code changes, affected docs are flagged for update. `doc-drift-scan` (part of periodic analysis) identifies docs whose described behavior no longer matches the code.

**External workflow ingestion:**
- Workflow registry/marketplace: `worktrain workflow install community/postgres-migration-workflow`
- Org-level workflow libraries: teams publish workflow libraries to a git repo. WorkTrain pulls from it.
- `workflowSources` config: list of git repos + local paths to discover workflows from

**Things to hash out:**
- Template injection ("use this template exactly") is a soft instruction to the LLM. How is compliance verified? If the agent diverges from the template, is that a workflow error or acceptable deviation?
- `doc-drift-scan` requires comparing documentation to code semantically. Is this an LLM-based comparison or a static analysis? What is the false positive rate for "this doc is out of date"?
- The workflow registry/marketplace concept requires trust decisions: which authors, which workflows, what versions are safe to install? Is there a vetting process or is it caveat emptor?
- How does the `workflowSources` config interact with the existing workspace source discovery mechanism? Is this additive or a replacement?
- "Living docs" updated continuously could produce many noisy documentation PRs. Should doc update frequency be throttled, or batched with code PRs?

### WorkRail engine / MCP features

**Status: done**

- Assessment gates v1 with consequences
- Loop control -- all four types (`while`, `until`, `for`, `forEach`) implemented
- Fix: sequential `artifact_contract` while loops -- stale stop artifacts from earlier loops no longer contaminate later loops (PR #830). Root cause: `collectArtifactsForEvaluation()` passed full session history to `interpreter.next()`; fix passes only `inputArtifacts` (current step's submitted artifacts).
- Subagent guidance feature
- References system (local file refs)
- Routine/templateCall injection
- Workspace source discovery
- Branch safety (never checkout main into worktree) -- enforced via trigger validation rules and worktree isolation in daemon; NOT a compiled `wr.features.*` engine feature
- Console execution trace Layers 1+2+3a
- Console MVI architecture
- `worktrain` CLI (logs, health, status, trigger validate)
- Notification service

### Scripts-over-agent design principle

**Status: done** -- codified in AGENTS.md and daemon-soul.md

The agent is expensive, inconsistent, and slow. Scripts are free, deterministic, and instant. Any operation the daemon can perform with a shell script, git command, or API call should be done that way -- not delegated to the LLM.

### Dynamic model selection

**Status: partial** -- raw model ID (`agentConfig.model`) shipped in `triggers.yml`. Two gaps remain: (1) no validation at trigger parse or startup -- a bad model ID is only caught when the first LLM call fires; (2) every trigger hardcodes a provider-specific ID, which breaks when the inference profile naming convention changes (e.g. `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` vs `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`).


### Multi-agent support (spawn_agent + coordinator sessions)

**Status: done (partial)** -- `spawn_agent` tool and coordinator sessions with `steer` are shipped. Full `spawn_session`/`await_sessions` as first-class workflow primitives is still an idea (see "Native multi-agent orchestration" above).

### WorkTrain onboarding (`worktrain init`)

**Status: done (basic version)** -- initial soul setup ships. The full guided LLM-provider + trigger + smoke-test onboarding flow described in the idea above is not yet built.

### Daemon context customization

**Status: done** -- `~/.workrail/daemon-soul.md`, AGENTS.md auto-inject, direct `start_workflow` call from daemon.

### Workflow complexity routing

**Status: done (partial)** -- `runCondition`/QUICK/STANDARD/THOROUGH rigor modes ship. A dedicated classify-task-workflow and the full dynamic pipeline coordinator are still ideas above.

### `wr.*` namespace rename

**Status: done** -- all bundled workflows renamed to `wr.*` namespace (PR #782).

### Metrics outcome validation

**Status: done** -- `checkContextBudget` validates `metrics_outcome` enum (PR f0a1822a). SHA validation (Gap 3 above) is still open.

### wr.coding-task architecture enforcement + retrospective (v1.3.0)

**Status: done** -- shipped in PR #830 (Apr 29, 2026)

- Phase 0 architecture alignment check: agent scans candidate files and names philosophy violations explicitly by function name; captures `architectureViolations` and `architectureStartsFromScratch`
- Phase 1c conditional fragment: when `architectureStartsFromScratch = true`, blocks adapting existing violations as valid design candidates
- Phase 8 post-implementation retrospective: runs for all tasks (no complexity gate); four practical questions applicable to any task; requires 2-4 concrete observations with explicit disposition



## WorkRail usage report as a mercury-mobile team script (May 4, 2026)

**Goal:** Make the WorkRail usage report dead simple to run for any mercury-mobile engineer -- one command, zero config beyond a GitLab token.

### Distribution

- Lives in mercury-mobile's common-ground team directory (`src/teams/mercury/mercury-mobile/scripts/workrail-report.sh`)
- Distributed to every mercury engineer's machine by common-ground via `make sync`
- Runnable as `~/.cg/dist/scripts/workrail-report.sh` or wrapped as a skill/alias

### What it does

1. Reads `~/.cg/config.toml` for the engineer's team identity
2. Reads `~/.cg/repo-list.cache` to resolve repo names to local paths
3. Scans `~/.workrail/data/sessions/` for sessions in the report window -- this is the authoritative source of what repos WorkRail was used on
4. Fetches GitLab MRs via API for each repo that had sessions
5. Builds the HTML report and writes to `~/Downloads/workrail-report-YYYY-MM-DD.html`
6. Auto-opens the report

### Configuration

- **Token:** checks `GITLAB_TOKEN` env var → `~/.cg/secrets` → prompts once and offers to save. Zero setup if engineer already has `GITLAB_TOKEN` set.
- **Date range:** defaults to last 30 days rolling. Override via `WORKRAIL_REPORT_DAYS=60 ./workrail-report.sh` or `--days 90` flag.
- **Nothing else** -- team, repos, and GitLab paths are all auto-detected.

### Report behavior

- Only shows repos where WorkRail sessions exist in the window -- absence is signal, not a bug
- Repos worked in outside WorkRail simply don't appear (the report is a WorkRail usage report, not a total productivity report)
- "WorkRail shipped" correlation tab disabled in distributed version -- too expensive to run automatically. Available as a separate manual step for advanced users.

### Error handling

- No WorkRail installed → clear message with install instructions
- No sessions in window → "No WorkRail activity in the last 30 days" with suggestion to check date range
- No GitLab token → prompt with instructions for creating one
- Repo not cloned locally → skip with note (LOC stats require local clone, rest of report works without it)

### Non-goals

- Not a team-level aggregated report (that's a future feature once `triggerSource` attribution is built)
- Not a real-time dashboard
- Not responsible for repos where WorkRail wasn't used

### Depends on

- The shared report scripts (`01-collect-sessions.py`, `02-collect-commits.py`, `04-build-html.py`) being stable -- ship this only after those are solid
- `triggerSource: 'daemon' | 'mcp'` attribution (backlog) for distinguishing autonomous vs manual sessions -- not blocking but would improve the report
- Common-ground `make sync` distributing the script reliably

**Priority:** Medium. The shared scripts work and have been tested. Main remaining work is the shell wrapper, token storage, and integration with common-ground's team config.

### Cross-system blind benchmark: compare AI coding tools/models on the same tasks (May 6, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 9** | Cor:1 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

There is no reproducible way to compare WorkTrain against other AI coding systems (Cursor, Copilot, raw Claude Code, competing agent frameworks) or to compare model families within WorkTrain on the same real tasks. Without this, claims about WorkTrain's quality are anecdotal and there is no principled way to understand where WorkTrain adds value versus where it falls short.

**Things to hash out:**
- What constitutes a valid "task" for comparison? Real GitHub issues from a well-understood repo are higher quality than synthetic benchmarks, but may not reproduce cleanly across different tool setups. What is the minimum reproducibility requirement?
- How do you grade fairly? A grader that can see code style, comments, or formatting may infer which system produced the output. What does true blind evaluation look like here, and how blind is "blind enough"?
- Should the rubric be global (same for all task types) or per-task-type (refactor vs feature vs bug fix)?
- Token usage comparison requires accurate per-system accounting. Not all tools expose this. Is a cost-adjusted comparison feasible, or does this reduce to a quality-only benchmark?
- Is this a one-time study or a continuous regression benchmark? The demo-repo benchmark entry covers regression -- this is specifically about cross-system comparative evaluation.

**Relationship to existing entries:** the demo-repo benchmark (existing entry) runs the same tasks after each WorkRail release to track regression. This entry is about comparing WorkTrain vs other systems, not WorkTrain past vs present.

### WorkTrain as a full software team: design, PM, data science, opex, and everything in between (May 6, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 13** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:1 Lev:3 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The current vision defines WorkTrain as an autonomous *software development* system. But shipping software requires more than coding -- product management, design, data science, operations, release engineering, and the feedback loop from production back into ideas are all necessary to deliver something that works and keeps working. WorkTrain currently handles only the coding-and-review slice of this. Everything before "write the code" (discovery what to build, analyzing what users actually need) and everything after "merge the PR" (instrumentation, metrics analysis, idea generation, rollout management, incident response) is done manually.

The result is that the value loop -- PR → metrics → insight → idea → spec → PR -- is only partially automated. Humans still have to bridge analysis → idea and metrics → iteration gaps. An autonomous system that stops at "ship a PR" requires continuous human intervention to keep it pointed at the right work.

The constraint on idea generation specifically: ideas grounded in vague intuition are not useful. The gap is not that WorkTrain can't generate suggestions -- it can. The gap is that those suggestions are not grounded in specific, verifiable facts about the actual system and its users. An idea like "23% of users who reach step 3 abandon, and the median time on that step is 47 seconds, and here is what the error logs show" is categorically different from "users might want X."

**Relationship to existing entries:** Many existing backlog entries are partial implementations of this broader capability -- monitoring loops, analytics integration, feature flag management, opex, the blind benchmark entry. This entry captures the full frame so those entries can be understood as steps toward it rather than isolated features.

**Things to hash out:**
- The vision.md defines WorkTrain as "autonomous software development." Does this require a vision revision, or is design/PM/data science/opex a natural extension of "everything that ships software"?
- Design and PM work requires product domain knowledge -- not just technical knowledge. There is no obvious equivalent of AGENTS.md for product context. What is the right mechanism for WorkTrain to acquire and maintain that context?
- Data science work requires access to event logs, metrics stores, and potentially sensitive user data. What is the authorization model? What is the minimum access needed to produce useful insights without exposing sensitive data?
- Release management requires write access to production systems (feature flag platforms, deployment infrastructure). What safeguards are necessary before WorkTrain can act autonomously there?
- Opex (incident response, SLO management) has a different urgency profile than coding work. How does it fit into the existing pipeline model, which is designed for hours-to-days timescales?

### Task completion enforcement: detect and prevent deferred work within tasks (May 6, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 12** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

Agents routinely defer work within tasks rather than completing it. Common patterns: "I'll file a ticket for this later," "this is out of scope, leaving for a follow-up," "TODO: handle this edge case," "I noticed X but didn't address it to stay focused." These deferral patterns are individually plausible but collectively mean tasks are never actually finished -- they transition from "in progress" to "apparently done" while work accumulates in a long tail of unfiled tickets and unresolved TODOs.

There is no mechanism to distinguish "this genuinely needs a separate session with different scope" from "I could have done this but chose not to." There is no enforcement that deferred items are tracked and eventually completed. There is no way to prove a task is actually done versus claimed done. A task that leaves TODOs in the code, or that defers 3 of its 5 acceptance criteria, is not done -- but the system currently has no way to detect or prevent this.

**Things to hash out:**
- What does "done" mean in a provable sense? What evidence would allow a coordinator to conclude that a task is complete rather than merely that an agent has stopped working on it?
- How do you distinguish legitimate scope decisions from avoidance? A session on a performance bug that surfaces an unrelated security issue is right to defer the security issue. A session that addresses only 2 of 3 acceptance criteria is not. What is the principled distinction?
- TODO comments in code are not always deferred work -- some are architectural notes, some are pre-existing. How do you identify TODOs that represent deferred task-scope work versus incidental notes?
- How does this interact with the existing stuck detection system? A stuck agent and a "done-claiming but not actually done" agent are different failure modes. How does the system tell them apart?

### worktrain CLI surface redesign: 18 commands → 14 (May 2026)

**Status: done** | Shipped PRs #1040, #1043, #1044

Previous surface had 18 commands with overlapping responsibilities, dead code, flags-as-verbs on `daemon`, no `session` namespace, no `dispatch`, and no machine-readable output. Redesign based on operator journeys and a full UX review (wr.ui-ux-design workflow with 5 reviewer families).

**What shipped:**
- `daemon start|stop|status|install|uninstall` as proper subcommands (was `daemon --start` etc). `DaemonSubcommand` discriminated union eliminates 5-boolean illegal state. `daemon status --json`.
- `session events|kill|resume|retry` namespace. `session events <id>` replaces `session-log`.
- `dispatch <task>` replaces `spawn`, `run pipeline`, `run pr-review`. Routes via daemon HTTP. `--wait` polls for terminal state (exit 0/1/2). `--json`, `--pr <n>`, `--workflow <id>`.
- 7 dead commands removed with migration messages: `spawn`, `await`, `run`, `health`, `status`, `run pipeline`, `run pr-review`.
- `--json` on `inbox` and `logs`. `tell --session <id>` routes to steer endpoint. `init --yes` non-TTY guard.

**What did NOT ship (follow-up items):**
- `session kill/resume/retry` are stubs -- daemon HTTP endpoints (`POST /api/v2/sessions/:id/abort|resume|retry`) not yet built
- `--follow` flag on `session events` for live tailing
- `inbox` response/acknowledge capability (gate decisions require operator response)
- Unit tests for `tell --session`, `inbox --json`, `logs --json`, `init` non-TTY path
- `dispatch --wait` uses `__exit2__` sentinel in CliResult message to signal exit code 2 -- tech debt until CliResult carries an exit-code field

### Daemon HTTP endpoints for session kill/resume/retry (May 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: high

**Score: 11** | Cor:3 Cap:2 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

The `worktrain session kill|resume|retry` CLI commands were shipped as stubs (exit 1, "not yet implemented"). The CLI surface is correct and stable -- the daemon-side HTTP routes are the missing piece.

**What's needed:**
- `POST /api/v2/sessions/:id/abort` on the trigger listener (port 3200): calls `agent.abort()` on the matching `ActiveSessionSet` handle, writes a `session_aborted` event, cleans up the sidecar file
- `POST /api/v2/sessions/:id/resume` on the trigger listener: reads the orphaned session sidecar, re-fires via `runWorkflow()` with a `pre_allocated` source
- `POST /api/v2/sessions/:id/retry` on the trigger listener: reads the sidecar for goal/workspace/workflowId, fires a fresh `runWorkflow()` from scratch

**Guards needed at the HTTP layer:**
- `kill`: session must be in `ActiveSessionSet` (not already complete/orphaned)
- `resume`: session must be orphaned (not in active set, has sidecar with `continueToken`)
- `retry`: check that session is not currently running before re-firing (prevent duplicate active sessions)
- `kill`/`retry`: honor `--force` flag from CLI (skip confirmation for scripts)

### `session events --follow` for live session tailing (May 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 10** | Cor:2 Cap:2 Eff:3 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

`worktrain session events <id>` currently does a one-shot read. `--follow` would poll the event log file for new lines and stream them as they arrive -- like `tail -f` but with the same structured rendering (timestamps, tool durations, SLOW markers).

Implementation is straightforward: after the initial render, enter a poll loop (1s interval) reading the file from the last offset, formatting and printing new lines as they arrive. Exit on SIGINT.

This is the foundation for the console Live tab and replaces the need to run `worktrain logs --session <id> --follow` for live debugging.

### Extend CliResult to carry exit-code field (May 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: low

**Score: 7** | Cor:2 Cap:1 Eff:1 Lev:2 Con:2 | Blocked: no

`dispatch --wait` currently uses a `__exit2__` sentinel prefix in the failure message to signal exit code 2 (timed out waiting for terminal event). This is a smell -- CliResult has no exit-code field and the sentinel is detected in the action handler before `interpretCliResultWithoutDI`.

The clean fix: add an optional `exitCode?: number` field to `CliResult.failure` (or add a new `CliResult.timeout` variant). Then `interpretCliResultWithoutDI` reads it and calls `process.exit(exitCode ?? 1)`. All existing callers are unaffected (no `exitCode` = default 1).

Low priority because the sentinel works correctly today and `dispatch --wait` is the only caller that needs exit code 2.

### Subagent Spawning in Auto-Injected Auditing and Verification Steps (May 31, 2026)

**Status: idea** | Priority: medium

**Score: 12** | Cor:2 Cap:3 Eff:2 Lev:2 Con:3 | Blocked: no

Currently, auto-injected virtual steps (audit, verification) run in-line in the main agent session. This means the main agent must execute the verification commands or perform the audit, which can introduce bias and waste parent tokens on complex verification environments.

If auto-injected steps support delegating to subagents, the compiler can dynamically compile the virtual step as a `ParallelStepDefinition` instead of a standard `WorkflowStepDefinition`, spawning a specialized subagent (e.g. wr.routine-code-reviewer) to review or verify the parent step's output in an isolated, unbiased workspace.

**Things to hash out:**
- How is the parallel step's synthesis step generated? When a subagent audit completes, a dynamic synthesis step must auto-adopt the subagent's claims/findings.
- What context variables are mapped into the child audit session from the parent?
- Supporting custom model selection for the delegated audit subagent.
