# Design Review Findings: queue-config separate file (fix/queue-config-separate-file)

*Generated: 2026-04-19 | Workflow: coding-task-workflow-agentic*

---

## Tradeoff Review

| Tradeoff | Assessment | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Constant name `WORKRAIL_CONFIG_PATH` is slightly misleading | Acceptable | WHY comment block explicitly explains the separation; constant is not exported for external use |

---

## Failure Mode Review

| Failure Mode | Risk | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Future developer reverts path to config.json | Low | WHY comment is the guard |
| Test environment missing queue-config.json | None | loadQueueConfig() returns ok(null) on ENOENT; no tests rely on the file existing |
| Build breaks due to import changes | None | Only string constant and comments change |

**Most dangerous**: Future revert. Adequately mitigated by the WHY comment.

---

## Runner-Up / Simpler Alternative Review

- **Runner-up (rename constant)**: No elements worth borrowing. Scope exceeds the task boundary.
- **Simpler variant**: There is no simpler variant -- this is already the minimal possible change.

---

## Philosophy Alignment

**Satisfied**: document-why (WHY comment), architectural-fixes-over-patches, YAGNI, make-illegal-states-unrepresentable, validate-at-boundaries.

**No risky tensions**.

## Findings

### RED: None

### ORANGE: None

### YELLOW: None

---

## Recommended Revisions

None. Proceed with Candidate A as specified.

---

## Residual Concerns

None for this targeted fix.

# Design Review Findings: GitHub Issue Queue Poll Trigger (#4)

*Generated: 2026-04-19 | Workflow: coding-task-workflow-agentic*

---

## Tradeoff Review

| Tradeoff | Assessment | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| workflow-runner.ts touch for bot identity | Acceptable | 5-line block after worktree creation, guarded by optional field |
| `events:` bypass for github_queue_poll | Acceptable | Separate `else if` branch, does not touch existing isPollingProvider block |
| No PolledEventStore for queue poll | Acceptable | Queue-poll semantics are select-one-per-cycle, not at-least-once-per-event |
| JSONL append non-atomicity | Acceptable | Single-process daemon, one queue-poll trigger -- safe for MVP |
| DaemonRegistry optional injection | Acceptable | File scan is the primary check; registry is a fast-path optimization |

---

## Failure Mode Review

| Failure Mode | Risk | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| FM1: events bypass breaks existing providers | Low | Separate else-if branch; isPollingProvider unchanged |
| FM2: idempotency returns 'clear' on parse error | **HIGH** | Must fold ALL errors to 'active'; requires explicit outer try/catch |
| FM3: concurrency cap checked after per-issue loop | Medium | Implementation order is explicit; must be enforced in code |
| FM4: H3 treated as maturity level | Low | Exclusion before scoring; design is explicit |
| FM5: not_implemented silently swallowed | Low | Logs error + returns; not silent |
| FM6: bot identity failure is non-fatal | Medium | Logs warning, session continues; commits have wrong author |
| FM7: rate limit not checked | Medium | Needs explicit check in adapter (same as github-poller.ts) |
| FM8: stale session file on readdir | Low | ENOENT folds to 'active'; safe by design |

**Most dangerous**: FM2. Implementation must have an outer `try/catch` that returns `'active'` for ANY error during idempotency scan, not just JSON parse errors.

---

## Runner-Up / Simpler Alternative Review

- **Runner-up (Candidate B: skip bot identity)**: No elements worth borrowing. Inferior -- violates determinism and pitch requirement.
- **Simpler variant**: No viable simpler approach for bot identity. Timing invariant (post-worktree) cannot be satisfied from scheduler layer.
- **Hybrid opportunity**: None identified. Making bot identity a triggers.yml field adds config complexity without benefit.

---

## Philosophy Alignment

**Satisfied**: errors-as-data, immutability, type safety, validate-at-boundaries, DI for boundaries, determinism, architectural-fixes-over-patches, exhaustiveness.

**Acceptable tension**: YAGNI vs. not_implemented scaffolding for non-assignee types (explicit pitch requirement).

**Risky tension**: Prefer-fakes-over-mocks vs. filesystem-dependent idempotency check. **Resolution**: Make `sessionsDir` parameter injectable (default: `DAEMON_SESSIONS_DIR`, overridable in tests).

---

## Findings

### RED: None

### ORANGE

**O1: Idempotency scan must fold ALL errors to 'active'**
Not just JSON parse errors -- ENOENT, permission errors, malformed structure, missing field. The outer catch must return `'active'`, never rethrow. If this is implemented incorrectly (e.g., only catching `SyntaxError`), FM2 occurs. Specific implementation requirement: `try { /* parse and check */ } catch { return 'active'; }` at the outer level of the per-file check.

**O2: `sessionsDir` must be injectable for tests**
The idempotency scan reads from `DAEMON_SESSIONS_DIR` (a hardcoded path to `~/.workrail/daemon-sessions/`). Tests that verify idempotency behavior need to write real files to a temp directory. Make `sessionsDir` an optional parameter defaulting to `DAEMON_SESSIONS_DIR`. This is a straightforward DI addition.

### YELLOW

**Y1: Rate limit check in queue poller**
The adapter must check `X-RateLimit-Remaining` from the GitHub Issues API response header (same pattern as `github-poller.ts` `checkRateLimit()`). Skip cycle if < 100. Not a design gap -- the pitch mentions it -- but needs explicit implementation.

**Y2: Bot identity failure logging**
If `git config user.name` fails after worktree creation, the failure should be logged as a WARNING (not error) and the session should continue. Commits will have wrong author, but session should not abort.

**Y3: H3 heuristic scope**
H3 checks `worktrain:in-progress` label. The pitch also mentions `worktrain:done` label as a skip reason. Verify the implementation covers both labels (or just `worktrain:in-progress` per pitch spec).

---

## Recommended Revisions

1. **Make `sessionsDir` injectable** in the idempotency check function -- pass as optional string parameter defaulting to `DAEMON_SESSIONS_DIR`.
2. **Outer try/catch for idempotency** -- catch block MUST return `'active'`, not throw or return `'clear'`.
3. **Rate limit check** -- add `checkRateLimit(response)` call in queue poller after issues list API response.
4. **H3 label check** -- check `worktrain:in-progress` label (per pitch heuristic table); `worktrain:done` is mentioned in the breadboard connections but not in the H3 heuristic table. Implement exactly as the H3 table specifies.

---

## Residual Concerns

- **workflow-runner.ts bot identity**: Small change, but in a large/critical file. Needs careful review after implementation.
- **TypeScript exhaustiveness**: After adding `github_queue_poll` to `PollingSource` union, any file with a switch on `pollingSource.provider` must handle the new arm. The `doPoll()` switch is the only such location identified. Verify during implementation.

# Design Review Findings: queue poll tasks route to FULL/IMPLEMENT not REVIEW_ONLY (fix/queue-routes-to-full-not-review)

*Generated: 2026-04-19 | Workflow: coding-task-workflow-agentic*

---

## Tradeoff Review

| Tradeoff | Assessment | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Type-level protection deferred | Acceptable | No current caller constructs taskCandidate + triggerProvider: 'github_prs_poll' together. WHY comment encodes the invariant textually. Type-level fix is a future dedicated task. |
| JSDoc correction co-located with code fix | Required | The wrong JSDoc is the encoded assumption that caused the bug. Must be fixed atomically with the code change. |

---

## Failure Mode Review

| Failure Mode | Risk | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Future developer re-introduces taskCandidate-based inference | Low | JSDoc correction + WHY comment at fix site are the guards |
| PR poll path (github_prs_poll) broken by fix | None | PR poller passes triggerProvider directly, never sets taskCandidate. Unaffected. |
| Routing log signal githubPrsPollProvider changes | None | Signal will correctly be false for queue tasks (correctness improvement, not a risk) |

**Most dangerous**: Future re-introduction. Adequately mitigated by JSDoc fix and WHY comment.

---

## Runner-Up / Simpler Alternative Review

- **Runner-up (Candidate B: type-level split)**: One element worth borrowing - a textual WHY comment at the fix site to encode the invariant. Already incorporated into selected design.
- **Simpler variant**: Fix code only, skip JSDoc correction. Rejected - wrong JSDoc is the encoded assumption that caused the bug; leaving it wrong is worse than both wrong.

---

## Philosophy Alignment

**Satisfied**: architectural-fixes-over-patches, YAGNI, determinism, document-why, immutability.

**Acceptable tension**: make-illegal-states-unrepresentable vs. explicit scope constraint. The type-level fix is the right long-term approach but is explicitly out of scope for this hotfix.

**No risky tensions**.

---

## Findings

### RED: None

### ORANGE: None

### YELLOW

**Y1: WHY comment required at fix site**
The fix removes the wrong inference but a future developer could re-introduce it. A WHY comment at lines 288-290 explaining that `taskCandidate` comes from `github_queue_poll` not `github_prs_poll` is required to prevent recurrence.

---

## Recommended Revisions

1. Add a WHY comment at the fix site (lines 288-290) explaining the correct relationship between `taskCandidate`, `github_queue_poll`, and `github_prs_poll`.
2. Fix JSDoc on `taskCandidate` field (line 113) to remove the wrong statement "When present, the trigger provider is 'github_prs_poll'".
3. Add a test case verifying that `runAdaptivePipeline` with `taskCandidate` set and no `triggerProvider` routes to FULL (not REVIEW_ONLY).

---

## Residual Concerns

None. This is a one-line fix with clear correct behavior. All three recommended revisions are straightforward and do not require human decisions.

# Design Review Findings: MCP Handoffs and Step-Attempt Exhaustion

*Generated: 2026-05-30 | Workflow: wr.discovery*

---

## Tradeoff Review

| Tradeoff | Assessment | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Relaxed circuit breaker limit (10 attempts) for MCP sessions | Acceptable | Protects against infinite loops / API quota runway in background agent sessions while granting ample room for human-in-the-loop debugging and corrections. |
| Passing `{ isAutonomous }` options bag from infra handlers to domain core | Acceptable | Keeps the domain model decoupled from MCP server or daemon runner execution processes. Uses standard TypeScript/Zod options bag pattern. |
| Non-blocking advisory logging on context mismatch | Acceptable | If `runContext` is missing, defaults to MCP-mode (false) which is safer for developer ergonomics. |

---

## Failure Mode Review

| Failure Mode | Risk | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| FM1: `runContext` lookup fails or defaults to `false` in production daemon | Low | Handled gracefully. Autonomous daemon runs always register `is_autonomous: 'true'` at session startup. If lookups fail, the system falls back to `isAutonomous = false` (MCP mode), which prevents permanent locking of the session. |
| FM2: MCP client loops endlessly and exhausts 10 attempts | Medium | Enforced. Once 10 attempts are exhausted, the circuit breaker still blocks the step, returning a clear `PRECONDITION_FAILED` error. In the error message, we provide clear instructions on how to rewind or rehydrate to recover. |
| FM3: Architectural boundaries violated by imports in domain | None | No infra libraries or MCP handlers are imported inside `reason-model.ts` or individual Zod schema files. The boundary is fully respected. |

**Most dangerous**: FM2. Mitigated by adding clear recovery/rewind instructions to the `blocked_attempt_limit_exceeded` error message.

---

## Runner-Up / Simpler Alternative Review

- **Runner-up (Candidate 2: Relaxed Limits with Console Banners)**: Console banners are completely invisible to automated MCP client agents (e.g. Claude Code), preventing automated recovery and self-correction. Candidate 1 is far superior.
- **Simpler variant (Candidate 4: Generic Dual Messages)**: Using vague, dual-referenced messages everywhere degrades the ergonomics for both the daemon and MCP runs. Dynamic formatting is much cleaner.

---

## Philosophy Alignment

**Satisfied**: context-aware safety, architectural decoupling, actionable self-correction, errors-as-data, type safety, validate-at-boundaries.

**No risky tensions**.

---

## Findings

### RED: None

### ORANGE: None

### YELLOW

**Y1: MCP attempt limit exceeded recovery instructions**
When an MCP session actually exhausts the 10-attempt limit, the error message returned must not just state that the limit is exceeded. It must explicitly tell the user how to recover (e.g., by checking their input or using a session rehydrate/rewind).

**Y2: First-pass validation requirements schema drift**
The prompt renderer renders system requirements on the very first try using static getBlockedMessage() calls which hardcode complete_step and outdated schema fields. This guarantees validation failure on attempt #1. We must pass `{ isAutonomous }` options to getBlockedMessage inside formatOutputContractRequirements in prompt-renderer.ts.

---

## Recommended Revisions

1. Ensure the `blocked_attempt_limit_exceeded` mapping in `continue-advance.ts` and `v2-error-mapping.ts` provides a generic, contract-accurate suggested fix and includes recovery instructions for the interactive human developer.
2. In `getArtifactBlockedMessage` and individual Zod schema functions, verify that the options bag is typed as `{ readonly isAutonomous?: boolean }` and defaults `isAutonomous` to `false` when omitted.
3. In `prompt-renderer.ts`, query the projected `sessionContext.is_autonomous` and pass it as options when calling `formatOutputContractRequirements` to ensure dynamic requirements are rendered correctly on the very first try.

---

## Residual Concerns

None. The design is robust, clean, and has clear, verifiable safety bounds.
