/**
 * Barrel re-export for src/daemon/runner/.
 *
 * Import boundary: runner/ files may import from io/, state/, core/, tools/,
 * and agent-loop.ts. They must NOT import runWorkflow from workflow-runner.ts
 * at runtime (that would be a circular dependency since workflow-runner.ts
 * calls runner/ functions). This is enforced by the architecture test in
 * tests/unit/architecture-boundaries.test.ts.
 *
 * runWorkflow is imported as `import type { runWorkflow }` in runner/ files --
 * type-only, erased at compile time, no runtime circular dependency.
