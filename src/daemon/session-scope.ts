/**
 * Per-session tool dependency injection types for the WorkTrain daemon.
 *
 * WHY this module exists: `constructTools()` in workflow-runner.ts previously
 * took a raw `Map<string, ReadFileState>` (plus several individual callback params)
 * as positional arguments. This module introduces:
 *
 *   1. `FileStateTracker` -- a named interface that encapsulates the Map, making
 *      read-before-write state access explicit and documentable.
 *
 *   2. `DefaultFileStateTracker` -- the standard implementation backed by a plain Map.
 *
 *   3. `SessionScope` -- a typed bundle of all per-session dependencies that
 *      `constructTools()` needs. Follows the same pattern as `TurnEndSubscriberContext`
 *      and `FinalizationContext` elsewhere in this file.
 *
 * WHY imports from types.ts (not workflow-runner.ts): ReadFileState is a domain type
 * that belongs in src/daemon/types.ts. The former import from workflow-runner.ts
 * created an incorrect dependency direction (scope module depending on orchestration).
