/**
 * Daemon startup crash recovery.
 *
 * WHY this module: these functions scan for orphaned session files from a
 * previous daemon crash and either resume them (if they have meaningful progress)
 * or discard them. They belong in their own module because crash recovery is a
 * distinct concern from the session execution path in runWorkflow().
 *
 * WHY this module may import node: modules: it IS I/O-heavy -- it reads session
 * files, decodes tokens, counts event log entries, and removes orphan worktrees.
 *
 * MAX_ORPHAN_AGE_MS and MAX_WORKTREE_ORPHAN_AGE_MS live here alongside the

 *   become eligible for re-dispatch within one poll cycle (~5 min).
 *

 *     Falls through to discard if sidecar lacks recovery context fields (backward compat),
 *     if the worktree directory is gone, if rehydrate fails, or if the session is complete.
 *   - stepAdvances === 0 -> discard (sidecar deleted; issue re-dispatched)

 *
 * Uses loadValidatedPrefix() instead of load() to handle truncated JSONL event logs
 * from a crash during append. Both 'complete' and 'truncated' kinds expose .truth.events.
 *
 * Returns 0 on any error (safe: caller falls back to discard).
 *
 * @param _parseFn - Injectable token parser. Receives the raw continueToken string and
 *   returns a ResultAsync<ContinueTokenResolved, ToolFailure>. Defaults to calling
 *   parseContinueTokenOrFail with ctx.v2.tokenCodecPorts and ctx.v2.tokenAliasStore.
 * @param _loadFn - Injectable session loader. Receives the WorkRail SessionId and
