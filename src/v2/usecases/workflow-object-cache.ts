/**
 * Process-level Workflow object cache.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 * createWorkflow() is called on every advance and rehydrate request for the same
 * pinned workflow. The definition is immutable (content-addressed by workflowHash),
 * so creating a new Workflow object each time is wasteful. This module memoizes the
 * Workflow object per workflowHash so the same frozen object is reused across requests.
 *
 * Safety:
 * - Pinned workflow definitions are immutable -- same hash always means same definition.
 * - The cache is unbounded by design. In practice the number of distinct pinned workflow
 *   hashes per process is small (one per unique workflow version used in an active session).
 *   This assumption breaks in multi-tenant or long-lived service deployments where many
 *   distinct workflow versions accumulate over time -- add eviction before using this
 *   module in such environments.
 * - clearWorkflowObjectCacheForTesting() is provided for test isolation only.
